# Am I transgender?

## For

* I've always hated my genitals.
* I've had thoughts of transitioning at multiple points in my life -
  possibly as early as 5 years old.
* Traditionally feminine things make me feel more comfortable.
* I'd sure as hell want to be reborn as a girl.
* I'd sure as hell want to transition.

## Against

* I'm not sure if experience gender dysphoria, and if I do, how strong
  it is, because of so many things fucked up in my life.
* I'm not sure if all of this isn't caused by something else.
* In case I'm not and I do transition, there's a chance I'd regret
  that for the rest of my life.
* In case I am, finding a good gender therapist here is impossible.
* In case I am, transitioning is not the best idea, considering in
  what country and with what people I live.
