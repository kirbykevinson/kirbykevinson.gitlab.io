i'm transgender

frequently asked questions:

q: are you kidding
a: no

q: who are you sexually attracted to
a: mostly women

q: how did you realize that
a: since i was a child, i've had a great desire to be a girl, but i
   always dismissed it as unrealistic. in 2019 i learned about The
   Trans Thingâ„¢, but i was managing to convince myself that there's
   no way i can be trans and i'm just a femboy. in early march 2020 my
   mom made a comment on my nail length and said something along the
   lines of "are you questioning your gender identity", and it
   finally cracked me

q: what's your transition plan
a: i'm gonna do what i've gotta do, and no one can stop me
