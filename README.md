This is the new statically generated version of my personal website.

## Dependencies

* Hugo
* Neocities CLI - optional
* rclone - optional

## How to deploy

```
make gitlab neocities[-full,-supporter]
```

See `Makefile` for more details.

## How to customize

The website uses a custom Hugo theme designed specifically for this
website. Even though I tried to make it behave like an actual theme,
it may still be difficult to change something and/or use it for a
different website. So if you decide to, good luck.

## Where is the old version

It's avaiable [here](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/old-website).
