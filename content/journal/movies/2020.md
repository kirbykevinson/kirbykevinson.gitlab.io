## 2020-04-10: The Room (2003)

Yeah, it kinda sucked. There's barely any plot and the characters are
empty, but that isn't the biggest problem, and the acting isn't
either... The sex scenes. Yes, too many of them. There's literally
like 2 in the first 20 minutes of the movie. It's so fucking annoying,
and the rest of the scenes being extremely awkward doesn't help. I
don't know, I didn't enjoy this one.

4/10

## 2020-05-04: 2001: A Space Oddysey

It's unbelievably amazing, and I don't know how it was possible to
make it back in 1968. Everything about this movie just blows my mind -
the soundtrack is denifitely among the best I've ever heard, the
visual effects look great even by this day, and the plot is so
pleasant despite being surreal and barely understandable. The acting
and the way the whole thing is composed were quite remarkable for me
too.

10/10
