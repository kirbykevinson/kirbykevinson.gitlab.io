## 2020-04-10: The Room (2003)

Yeah, it kinda sucked. There was barely any plot and the characters
were empty, but that wasn't the biggest problem, and the acting wasn't
either... The sex scenes. Yes, too many of them. There's literally
like 2 in the first 20 minutes of the movie. It's so fucking annoying,
and the rest of the scenes being extremely awkward doesn't help. I
don't know, I didn't enjoy this one.

4/10
