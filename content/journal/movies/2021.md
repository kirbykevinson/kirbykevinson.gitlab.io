## 2021-03-05: Raya and the Last Dragon

Overall, it's a pretty good princess movie. The dragons look cute and
the women are strong, which I like like. The world it's set in is
nothing out of ordinary but still manages to be engaging. I think it'd
look cool in a video game or a TV show. The whole thing ends on an
emotional moment, but it could me more dramatic to fit my tastes.

8/10

## 2021-03-06: Tom & Jerry (2021)

I wasn't as bad as I expected but still not good enough. The film
tries to balance between the original story and the Tom and Jerry
clusterfuck we all know and love since childhood but fails miserably -
there's just not enough Tom and Jerry. The story itself may not be the
best and may be cringy and unfunny in some parts, but it could be much
worse. Another thing to mention here is the visuals. Even though
cartoony animals in a realistic world don't look the best, at least
it's not as bad as it could've been if they went for a completely
realistic approach.

## 2021-03-23: Nobody (2021)

It's awesome. I came with high expectations and there were more than
satisfied. The idea of a movie where the good guy gets plain revenge
on the bad guy doesn't sound too good on paper, but oh boy, it was
executed perfectly. The whole story is pretty interesting to watch
unfold, which is additionally fuelled by nice acting. The main part of
the movie, the scene where the main character slaughters dozens of bad
guys, was also executed pretty well. The violence level is just about
what I like, i.e. really fucking high. It was really satisfying to
watch so many people die.

One interesting thing about the movie is that it features Russian
characters actually speaking Russian, meaning not dubbed. It does
sound a bit out of place but is still satisfying to hear.

This cinema visit wasn't quite ordinary. First, there were barely any
people (like, 6 of them without me), which is sort of strange because
I thought this movie was pretty big. Second, a family was watching the
movie there with their 5-year-old daughter. What the fuck? Don't they
think this movie is *maybe* a little too violent for her? Also this
baby asshole made stupid comments on the movie that made absolutely no
fucking sense. I mean what can you even expect from a child? In any
case, she shut the fuck up at some point, so thank God.

## 2021-04-27: Wrath of Man

The best I can describe this film is "uninspiring." I'd probably say
that the ending was pretty good, relatively speaking, but the movie
overall was meh. The plot has some interesting ideas, but it feels
like the movie isn't even trying to be epic. There's barely any
swearing, and even though the movie succeeds at killing as many
side-characters as possible, the level of voilence is just too low.
And in addition to all of that, it's pretty boring. Overall, I'm
disappointed because the movie looks like it wants to be good but
isn't trying hard enough.

6/10
