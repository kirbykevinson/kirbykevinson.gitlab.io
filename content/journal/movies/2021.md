## 2021-03-05: Raya and the Last Dragon

Overall, it's a pretty good princess movie. The dragons look cute and
the women are strong, which I like like. The world it's set in is
nothing out of ordinary but still manages to be engaging. I think it'd
look cool in a video game or a TV show. The whole thing ends on an
emotional moment, but it could me more dramatic to fit my tastes.

8/10

## 2021-03-06: Tom & Jerry (2021)

I wasn't as bad as I expected but still not good enough. The film
tries to balance between the original story and the Tom and Jerry
clusterfuck we all know and love since childhood but fails miserably -
there's just not enough Tom and Jerry. The story itself may not be the
best and may be cringy and unfunny in some parts, but it could be much
worse. Another thing to mention here is the visuals. Even though
cartoony animals in a realistic world don't look the best, at least
it's not as bad as it could've been if they went for a completely
realistic approach.
