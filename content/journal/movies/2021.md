## 2021-03-05: Raya and the Last Dragon

Overall, it's a pretty good princess movie. The dragons look cute and
the women are strong, which I like like. The world it's set in is
nothing out of ordinary but still manages to be engaging. I think it'd
look cool in a video game or a TV show. The whole thing ends on an
emotional moment, but it could me more dramatic to fit my tastes.

8/10
