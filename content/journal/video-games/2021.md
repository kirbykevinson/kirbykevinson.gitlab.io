Much better than the Lost Levels, but far from being as good as 3.
Overall, not that bad for the American release. Also I like the
originality of the game - it introduces new characters which are
different but still do fit the vibe of the series.

Nice game.

The game has disappointingly small amount of content. There's just
nothing to talk about.

This game is completely broken. At first it's funny seeing all those
glitches that make the game seem like it actually knows what you're
doing and is playing against you, but later in the game it fucks
everything up because the game becomes unplayable. What kind of a
sadist even designed all those late levels? There's absolutely no way
you can avoid all that shit flying all over the screen without taking
a single hit, which you apparently need to progress. In any case, it
seems like the game is so bugged out, it's a miracle to actually
complete it, so I won't torture myself more by trying to play it
again. One cool thing, though, about this game is its killer
soundtrack. Too bad it's being paused every time any other sound
effect plays and it's the only fucking song you hear in the whole
game.

4/10
