## 2014-??-??: Outlast

This is the first and the last horror game I've ever played. I was
shitting my pants the first time I was playing it, but I adapted after
some time. In addition to that, the game has a lot of disgusting crap,
but it absolutely didn't bother me. It was kinda interesting for me to
complete it, and I enjoyed it long after I did it by messing up with
internal game mechanics and discovering various things that were
intended to be seen only by the developers.

## 201?-??-??: Super Mario Bros.

Yes, it did take me so long to get my hands on completing it. Other
than that, this game is a legend and needs no explanation.

## 201?-??-??: Everlasting Summer

I don't even know why I decided to play a visual novel. In any case,
it was kinda okay. Also playing one of the mods put me in a depressive
period, and I'm still not sure why.

## 2019-01-0?: Undertale

Fuck. This game is incredible. It's the video game equivalent of
Gunbuster - a miracle that somehow makes me feel genuinely happy.
Everything here is perfect: the music is amazing, the story is
touching, the jokes are lame but good enough for me, the visuals are
simple but very pleasant. I still sucked balls at completing it
though.

This shit can barely be classified as a game, but I still kinda like
it. Also this is the only game where I **literally** die instantly.
