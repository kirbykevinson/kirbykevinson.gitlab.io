## 2020-10-17: Deltarune: Chapter 1

So far the game is even more amazing than Undertale. I'm so excited
for the full release.

Despite the game being technically interesting, it didn't scare me for
shit and was really boring for the most part. Not good.

5/10

## 2020-11-14: Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels

Basically, it's the same game but unfairly harder.

6/10

## 2020-11-18: Kirby's Dream Land

This was supposed to be the easiest game ever, so how come I still
sucked at it? But in any case, the game is too short for my liking but
still worth playing. Its aesthetics and music are quite remarkable,
especially for the Game Boy.

7/10
