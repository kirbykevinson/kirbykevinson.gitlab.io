## 200?-??-??: Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse

This is the first video game I've ever played. Or maybe it's not, but
I don't remember playing anything before that and barely have any
memories of myself at that age at all. The game is forever engraved in
my brain, and just seeing the visuals or especially hearing the sound
effects makes my heart melt instantly. And I do think that my feelings
are completely justified because the game still looks and sounds
amazing, and it was incredibly fun to play it as a child.

Also here's an fun fact: Freddi is a girl, but I've always thought she
was a boy. I guess it's not that easy to determine the gender of a
fish after all.

10/10

## 200?-??-??: Heroes of Might and Magic III

I managed to beat the tutorial map; that counts as a completion,
right? This game is also kinda engraved in my brain but much less. The
game as a stragedy is pretty cool, I guess, but I can't imagine a game
where I sucked more balls than here. The best thing about this game is
the music - it's soooooooooooooo fucking great. I can't express how
much I love how the harp is used there. Also my favorite track is the
Fortress town theme which sounds really groovy for classical music.

7/10

## 200?-??-??: a bunch of point and click games

I can't even find them anymore, but they were interesting to play.
Maybe if I decide to dig deep enough, I'll find them one day. Also I
still like this genre.
