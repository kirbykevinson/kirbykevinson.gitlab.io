## Minecraft

This game is an absolute masterpiece and my favorite game of all time,
which I started playing in 2013 and haven't even completed once yet.
What a shame.

## Super Mario Bros. 3

I fucking love this part of Mario, but it's really long and really
hard for me. I swear I'll complete the whole thing one day.
