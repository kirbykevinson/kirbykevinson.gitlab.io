(Ones I don't develop anymore and don't have any intention to develop
again)

## 2015-1X-XX/2016-02-18: [{Nblm,Null}Browser](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/nblmbrowser)

"Web browser" made using MSHTML and later NWJS. Pretty weird choice
for the first JavaScript project, isn't it?

## 2016-03-25/2016-04-28: [BirchBrowser](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/BirchBrowser)

"The revival" of NullBrowser.

## 2016-06-21/2016-09-06: [BFJS](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/BFJS)

BrainFuck compiler made in JavaScript for educational purposes.

## 2016-08-21/2016-09-05: [BBrowser](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/BBrowser)

Yet another reborn of NblmBrowser.

## 2016-08-31/2016-09-05: [ImaVi](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/ImaVi)

Viewnior copycat I decided to make because I thought I needed to
release more shit that uses NWJS.

This game is a tale on itself. A tale of how you shouldn't try to make
a game before you have a slightest idea how unless you *really* want
to suffer.

The idea was simple: combining ideas from such games as Minecraft and
Stranded II and using them in a slightly unusual and relatable
(soviet) setting. A good person that could design the game and draw
some sprites was even found (my friend), but there was a little
problem: I barely knew JavaScript and absolutely didn't know how to
make video games. Well, I still don't, but it's not so important.
Expectedly, the game went through multiple layers of development hell
and was never finished enough to be actually playable by
non-masochists. We still had a lot of fun though :)

## 2017-02-07/2019-01-26: [tuserver](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/tuserver)

Very bad implementation of a ToberUberStobe multiplayer server.

## 2017-09-24/2019-02-16: [PPL](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/PPL)

Attempt at creating a public domain-like software license for no
reason.

## 2018-04-03/2020-02-29: [gamestaddle](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/gamestaddle)

Very bad HTML 5 game engine. The project was moved, renamed, and
reborn multiple times and died while being rewritten to use Web
Components.

## 2018-05-08/2019-07-09: [assworder](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/assworder)

Password generator that utilizes the whole Unicode range.

## 2019-02-21/2019-11-29: [mewie](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/mewie)

Programming language with a questionable concept but some good ideas.
The project died even before being finished.

## 2019-05-01/2020-02-19: [abc-ng](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/abc-ng)

Alternative English alphabet I created for questionable reasons.
