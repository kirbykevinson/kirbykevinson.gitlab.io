(Ones I actually develop)

## 2016: [This website](/)

Initially intended to just host links to my profiles, now it serves as
full-fledged personal website with a blog, a journal, and other stuff.

## 2018: [My dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/dotfiles)

Horrible-quality GNU/Linux (and Android) rice you absolutely shouldn't
even try to use.

## 2019: [khansoul](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/khansoul)

Terminal emulator I made because I thought other ones were too
bloated.

## 2019: H\*\*\*: C\*\*\*\*\* R\*\*\*\*\*\*

Secret writing project. Can't reveal anything yet.

## 2020: [ethmenu](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/ethmenu)

Menu I made because I thought dmenu wasn't bloated enough.

## 2020: The Great Archival Projectâ„¢

Put simply, this is my effort to document as much of my life as
possible (without revealing too much, of course) until it's too late
because I forgot everything. This page was made as a part of this
project.
