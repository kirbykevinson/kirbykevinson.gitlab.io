## 201X-XX-XX: The Mysterious Island

My grandma forced me to read this because I was (and still am) a lazy
fucker. The story was pretty cool, but I'd rather watch a movie based
on it in any case.

## 2017?-XX-XX: The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster

It's pretty fun to read, especially considering it's technically a
religious book.

7/10

## 2019-0X-XX: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory

I've read the book, but I'm still an idiot with no music theory
knowledge. Smh.

 ## 2019-XX-XX: [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)

The shit gets straight to the point, is available on its own website,
and manages to interest me, who doesn't give much shit about
typography. What else do you need?
