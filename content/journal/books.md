The same as for [anime] but for books. Also who the hell even reads
them nowadays.

## 201X-XX-XX: The Mysterious Island

My grandma forced me to read this because I was (and still am) a lazy
fucker. The story was pretty cool, but I'd rather watch a movie based
on it in any case.

## 2017?-XX-XX: The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster

It's pretty fun to read, especially considering it's technically a
religious book.

7/10

## 2019-0X-XX: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory

I've read the book, but I'm still an idiot with no music theory
knowledge. Smh.

## 2019-XX-XX: [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)

The shit gets straight to the point, is available on its own website,
and manages to interest me, who doesn't give much shit about
typography. What else do you need?

## 2021-02-23: [The Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/)

I think it's pretty good book when it comes to covering such a topic
as gender. The information presented here is quite interesting and not
obvious, which sometimes can't be said about other LGBT materials.
Also it's really great in terms of being helpful - I've become more
confident in myself since reading it, and I certainly would recommend
it for another person to read if they want to learn more about the
LGBT topics. The whole thing, however is quite far away from perfect
because there could be more info on less popular topics, such as
non-binary people.
