## 2021-02-22: Leda: The Fantastic Adventure of Yohko

This anime is a very interesting case because of its plot, which is
usually not the most important thing I care about. The whole movie
takes only 70 minutes but manages to tell a lot of things and does it
in a very interesting way. Compare this to First of the North Star,
for example, which is longer than Your Name but tells you jack shit.
To pull off this kind of thing, the anime has a very, and I mean
*very*, self-contained story, which I'm usually a fan of. Not a lot of
background information is given about the world, but the one that is
still manages to kind of impress you. The story itself is sort of
interesting but not crazy enough for my tastes. Apart from the story,
the film was also pretty good - the visuals are neat and the music
isn't annoying. Overall, a pretty good watch.

## 2021-03-02: One Punch Man

Overall, it was not a bad show. The idea to make a show about a
literal undefeatable hero that destroys everyone with a single punch
sounds risky to me, but the way it was implemented here is pretty
good. The whole thing is pretty epic, but it's quite far from the most
epic thing I've seen. One problem is that I feel like it lacks soul
behind it, and I'm not sure how to describe it.

The "guy does good things but doesn't get credited for it" trope here
needs a separate mention. I understand that it's essential to the
whole show and that without it wouldn't work, but I just can't stand
it. It makes me actually feel something, which is a good thing, but at
the same time it makes me hate watching it. The show just treats you
like a complete fucking idiot that can believe something like it. I
mean come on, even crowds in real life are not that stupid.

What I'm now afraid of is watching the sequel. The whole thing is
pretty self contained, and I feel like continuing this story is nearly
impossible to do properly. Well, we'll see.
