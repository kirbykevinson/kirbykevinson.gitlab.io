## 2021-02-22: Leda: The Fantastic Adventure of Yohko

This anime is a very interesting case because of its plot, which is
usually not the most important thing I care about. The whole movie
takes only 70 minutes but manages to tell a lot of things and does it
in a very interesting way. Compare this to First of the North Star,
for example, which is longer than Your Name but tells you jack shit.
To pull off this kind of thing, the anime has a very, and I mean
*very*, self-contained story, which I'm usually a fan of. Not a lot of
background information is given about the world, but the one that is
still manages to kind of impress you. The story itself is sort of
interesting but not crazy enough for my tastes. Apart from the story,
the film was also pretty good - the visuals are neat and the music
isn't annoying. Overall, a pretty good watch.

7/10
