## 2020-01-10: Super Dimension Fortress Macross

I don't know, it just doesn't work good enough for what I expected
from a space anime. The plot is fairly simple and isn't bizzare
enough. The visuals are kinda fucked up and the music, despite being
really good (especially the opening theme), is overall repetitive, but
I guess they had some budget and/or time problems with that.

6/10

## 2020-02-25: Princess Mononoke

This was the time when I decided to watch an anime dubbed. The dub was
kinda awkward at first, but overall pretty good. The anime itself,
though. Good fucking lord, it's incredible. I can't say much about the
plot (and I'm also not the biggest fan of fantasy), except it works,
but the music and especially the visuals are much better than I
could've ever expected and they absolutely blew up my mind.
