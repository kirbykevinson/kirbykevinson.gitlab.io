## 2020-01-10: Super Dimension Fortress Macross

I don't know, it just doesn't work good enough for what I expected
from a space anime. The plot is fairly simple and isn't bizzare
enough. The visuals are kinda fucked up and the music, despite being
really good (especially the opening theme), is overall repetitive, but
I guess they had some budget and/or time problems with that.

6/10
