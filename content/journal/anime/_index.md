Every anime I've ever seen is described and rated here.

The rating system is about as follows:

* 10 - Masterpiece
* 9 - Masterpiece, but something is fucked up
* 8 - Awesome
* 7 - Very good
* 6 - Good
* 5 - Average
* 4 - Crappy
* 3 - Bad
* 2 - Very bad
* 1 - CrazyBus turned into an anime

Also I can't write reviews for shit, everything is based only on my
experience, blah, blah, blah, you get it.
