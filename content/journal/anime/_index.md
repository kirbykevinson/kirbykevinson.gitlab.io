Every anime I've ever seen is described and rated here. The rating
system is about as follows:

* 10 - Masterpiece
* 9 - Awesome
* 8 - Very good
* 7 - Good
* 6 - Average
* 5 - Mediocre
* 4 - Shitty
* 3 - Barely watchable
* 2 - Barely an anime
* 1 - CrazyBus

Also I can't write reviews for shit, everything is based only on my
experience and terribly biased towards traditional animation and 16 mm
film, blah, blah, blah, you get it.
