## 2007?-0X: Yevpatoria, Crimea

I don't have many memories left of it, but the ones I do are pretty
weird. We traveled there by train, and I think had motion sickness or
something, so they fed me some salt? I don't know. Other than that, I
remember a couple of frames of random buildings, and I also have a
photo of me holding a parrot on the beach. I think I enjoyed the trip
back then in any case.

## 2015-08: Krasnodar Krai, Russia

It was decided to travel by car, but, as it turned out, Russia is
really damn big. We spent less time in our destination than we did
driving, but at least in the end I've seen a lot of interesting stuff.

## 2017?-0X: Alanya, Turkey

This was the first time I've ever visited a non-CIS country and the
first time I've ever traveled by plane. We stayed in a pretty low-tier
hotel, but it was a cool unique experience in any case.

## 2018?-0X: some town in Turkey

It was pretty much like the previous time but with more food and in a
better hotel.

## 2019-07: some town in Turkey

Also pretty much like the previous time but in an even better hotel
and with a Jeep safari ride or whatever it's called.

## 2019-08: [Moscow, Russia](https://imgur.com/a/H57ir2K)

Despite the weather being depressive a large portion of time and
soviet architecture being everywhere, visiting this city was an
amazing experience. If we exclude the possibility of moving the fuck
out to an actually decent country, I'd 100% prefer living there than
in this shithole.

## 2020-07: London, UK (canceled)

Big thanks to the 2019 coronavirus for ruining my plans of finally
visiting a country I like. God fucking dammit, this was going to be
the first time I visit something alone, and I hate it so much that I'm
not going to for at least a year more.
