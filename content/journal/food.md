Yes, I've never tried good food in my entire life.

## 200X-XX-XX: tap water

A robust solution for hydrating yourself coupled with a great taste
and unmatched availability. What else do you need?

10/10

## 200X-XX-XX: sparkling water

Literally the worst shit ever.

## 200X-XX-XX: vinegret

I can't possibly imagine what kind of drug you have to be on to
tolerate this kind of shit. This "salad" is pure evil that consists of
the worst combination of vegetables and seasoning possible, and I want
to puke just by looking at it. Under no circumstance am I gonna eat
this meal, even if someone tries to force me. I had enough of it in my
childhood, so no, thank you.

## 200X-XX-XX: Grandma's borscht

You may be surprised, but I do actually like it. Yes, I know, it's
basically vinegret with additions, but I can't describe how much
better it tastes. There's just something about it being a soup and not
a salad and better proportions of the ingredients that bring it from
the shit tier to the pretty good tier.

## 2018?-XX-XX: Grilnitsa Tsarskaya shawarma

Basically, this is the perfect shawarma. It tastes like no other
shawarma I've ever tried and does it in a good way. As far as I
understand, this is achieved by using high-quality ingredients and
food processing technology. One drawback of this is that it's kinda
expensive, but I can assure you that paying this price is worth it.

## 2018?-XX-XX: microwave sandwich

### Recipe

* Bread
* Salami
* Cheese

1. Take a slice of bread
2. Put salami on the bread
3. Put cheese on the salami
4. Put the whole thing in the microwave for 40 seconds

### Review

Surprisingly, it's pretty good. It doesn't taste too bad and is really
easy and quick to make, so that's why I did it so many times. Of
course, there is better food you can make by yourself, but overall why
not eat it if you have an opportunity?

## 2021-01?-XX: KFC cheeseburger

This is by far the best meal you can get at KFC. To begin with, it's
really cheap. For less than $1, you get 2 chicken strips wrapped with
bread and sauce. Additionally, the quality of these ingredints is
quite high, and the whole thing doesn't taste like it's some kind of
bullshit you can get at a soviet school canteen. For example, the
strips actually taste like chicken and not some overfried patty made
out of questionable meat. And lastly, it's taste is just unbelievably
good. Even compared to other more expensive KFC burgers, it's quite
remarkable. The cheese sauce fits the chicken perfectly and the onion
and pickles only improve this perfection.

## 2021-02?-XX: echpochmak

Not a very interesting meal. It's just boiled meat wrapped in baked
dough. Sounds pretty mediocre to me. Wouldn't recommend.

6/10

## 2021-02?-XX: Borjomi mineral water

Пиздец.

1/10

## 2021-05-08: {McDonald's,Burger King} Heinz cheese sauce

This is by far the worst substance I've ever got from a fast food
place. It literally tastes like stale sour cream. Please don't repeat
my mistakes and don't try it.
