## 2020-02-07

The ridiculousness of the educational program I have to follow made me
completety lose any will to live, and I had an insane panic attack in
the evening.

## 2020-02-08

Shitcoding in Python temporarily lifted my mood. Also I found [a cool
song].

## 2020-02-09

I finally finished the website, which is great. Other than that, the
whole day I was trying not to blow up again because the 5-day-long
mental rape starts tomorrow, and I was mostly successful.

## 2020-02-10

It actually wasn't that bad, but I felt sick as shit the whole day.

## 2020-02-11

Everything was alright, except still being sick and not having quite
enough time to do all the stuff I'd planned. Also my website finally
doesn't suck as much and has an actual blog.

## 2020-02-12

Still sick and still no time. Fuck.

## 2020-02-13

Not as sick now; still keeping on being not in the shittiest mood.
Still no time, though, but the weekend is close, and I hope I'll
finally be able to experiment with my rice and watch some anime.

## 2020-02-14

I genuinely felt happy like I did most of the time 4 previous days.
This is really unusual, but I hope it stays.

## 2020-02-15

No anime, yes rice. In any case, I'll also have time tomorrow.

## 2020-02-16

I didn't. Also no rice this time. I could barely find anything to
enjoy today. Overall, my mood got about as shitty as usual. Also I
started to think more about uploading this website to Neocities, but
God knows how much time it'll take to force myself to do that if
things go as they always do.

## 2020-02-18

I spent really too much time thinking about the font size on my
website for little reason. Luckily, it seems like I mostly fixed it.
Other than that, the day fucking sucked, and I'm also now being forced
by the place I'm studying in to participate in a completely ridiculous
singing(!) competition, and I die inside every time I even think of
it. I'll, of course, try my absolute best to skip it because it's a
torture worse than almost any other one.

## 2020-02-19

I nearly exploded in panic while studying, but I did it. It'll
probably cause me some trouble later, but I don't care. After getting
home, I somehow managed to lift my ass and take care of my projects,
but not as much as actually writing any significant code. Overall, it
could be worse, but I still wish I was dead.

## 2020-02-20

No trouble yet. Except maybe having to listen to the rest of the group
singing their shit the second time. Other than that, I could barely
move and, of course, I didn't do anything I'd planned.

## 2020-02-21

I was so fucking tired both physically and mentally the whole day.
Listening to city pop and mostly finishing ethmenu lifted my mood but
not much.

## 2020-02-22

The day began with nearly shitting my pants while still being in bed.
After doing one study-related thing, I came back home and fell asleep
at about 5 PM. I woke up at least 2 times and felt really really sick.
I woke up at about 7 AM the next day, so I couldn't actually write
this entry on the stated date.

## 2020-02-23

Less sick, also did some website and Python stuff. Overall, not that
bad.

## 2020-02-24

Everything got worse. A lot. I wish I wasn't alive.

## 2020-02-25

I finally managed to watch an anime, and it just happened to be one of
the best I've ever seen. But it still couldn't completely fix the fact
that I feel like shit.

## 2020-02-26

I kept thinking the whole day about what I'd watched, but it coupled
with feeling sick created a very unpleasant surreal feeling that I've
already experienced many times before. I hope it goes away soon. Also
I planned to add bookmarks or shit to this website, but, fuck, there's
no time again.

## 2020-02-27

The feeling is mostly gone, but it was replaced by suicidal thoughts.
I mean, considering what a pathetic, lazy, useless, and miserable cunt
I am, and what country I live in, there's no way my life will ever get
better, and it makes perfect sense to just end it all. Other than
that, I still feel kinda sick and tired as fuck.

## 2020-02-28

Though I feel a little bit better, nothing interesting happened except
suddenly falling asleep for 6 hours.

## 2020-02-29

I finally got my hands on Neocities and even almost made a cool 1990s
styled theme for my website. I still feel like shit physically, but
better mentally.

## 2020-03-01

The theme has been mostly finished, and some new city pop has been
discovered. The last thing I want to do now is to study.

## 2020-03-02

Don't want to live, don't have any time, but do feel like shit.

## 2020-03-03

It got much worse. I feel really hopeless and almost like I'm going
insane. Some progress was made with Neocities, but not much,
considering the aforementioned problem.

## 2020-03-04

I felt even worse in the morning, but it got better after studying.
The issues that caused me to feel so weren't fixed though. The
Neocities version of the website is complete, but some polishing is
still needed. I added the background music, which I had to host on the
Gitlab Pages version of the website because it turned out uploading
audio files to Neocities is a bad idea. It was a kinda pain in the ass
to exclude the audio folder from being uploaded (and rejected) each
time, and I hope they won't mistakingly ban me or something.

## 2020-03-05

Pretty much nothing happened. I felt about as shitty as yesterday but
had almost no time to do anything. Also I came up with a weird social
media concept while studying, but I'm not sure if I'll ever implement
it.

## 2020-03-06

My mood was shittier, and I definitely was thinking about killing
myself more than yesterday. I was supposed to have time today, but I
didn't because I'm a lazy fucker. It's finally the weekend, and I hope
I'll be able to do the work on my website I'd planned (polishing the
Neocities version + adding more personal stuff) and watch some movies
and anime I've wanted to watch for a long time.

## 2020-03-07

I spent the whole day doing nothing and sometimes updating the
website. That's it.

## 2020-03-08

The same as yesterday, except I spent even less time on the website
and felt emptier inside. Also I finally followed the Neocities'
websites that I like to not lose them.

## 2020-03-09

[Another cool song] has been found. Other than that, everything's like
yesterday but worse.

## 2020-03-10

Right after writing the previous entry, I had a sudden panic attack
similar to one that happened on 2020-02-07. Or is it called a mental
breakdown? I've always used these terms more or less interchangeably,
and Wikipedia and other web resources doesn't help much with
understanding. Also my self-harm went a little bit too far this time,
but I guess it's okay. While all of this was happening, I was
constantly relistening that song, and I suspect overall I spent like 7
hours listening to it.

In any case, I had barely any sleep and was more than an hour late to
study. After studying, I finally decided to do something to my barely
alive phone after procrastinating to do that for probably more than a
month. Later I watched some videos and just fell asleep for the whole
day, and that was it.

## 2020-03-11

I woke up several times while sleeping and felt like shit, but the
classes started later than usual, so I had time to fully wake up, and
it got better. While the phone is still being repaired, I have to do
everything on my PC, and it's hard as fuck because I have to be
outside sometimes and really want to just lie on the bed all the time.
Also I'm so stupid, I forgot to save the data from it. This includes
my playlist and YouTube subscriptions. I guess I'll have to recreate
them from scratch and might as well upload them here. After getting
back home, I spent the whole time doing nothing and thinking about if
I should use a cloud file storage and which one.

## 2020-03-12

I'm back to having almost no sleep. Also a groupmate said something
that made me excessively think about suicide and I almost blew up
while trying to study. I have a lot of things that I want and/or need
to do, but there's barely any time, and I doubt there will be enough
on the weekend.

## 2020-03-13

I felt kinda shitty, and my Internet connection did too. Pretty much
nothing else happened, except I came up with another insane project
idea - a digital ID card. The chances of me implementing it are even
lower than for that social network one.

## 2020-03-14

As I expected, I neither did anything I'd planned nor enjoyed the
weekend (yet). Also I spent a ridiculous amount of time thinking if I
made the wrong choice by not using a copyleft license for my projects
and how I can fix the situation. I even went as far as writing a email
to a licensing organization. My head is full right now and I have
barely any energy to even move.

## 2020-03-15

When I woke up, I felt pretty happy, and it even escalated to an
almost orgasmic feeling, but later I felt kinda empty inside and
drained. The only thing I managed to do is to finally recover the
YouTube subscriptions. Also I listened to other Idris Muhammad's songs
and found [another nice one].

[another nice one]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOmTH9m4Lk8 "Idris Muhammad - The Doc"

## 2020-03-16

I was slightly happy when the last day ended and after I woke up, but
I made a huge mistake by thinking about my life while (pretending to
be) studying. In any case, my phone is back, and missing it for
several days has taught me some important lessons:

* It's better to just use the desktop at home.
* It's better not to use it outside.
* It's better to limit its usage overall.
* The regular dark theme (not the completely black one) doesn't
  actually suck that much.

It also reminded me of how poorly I was backing up my data and that
some of the apps that I used are outdated.

## 2020-03-17

I'm so fucking tired. My mood keeps changing between a very optimistic
one and the "nothing makes sense; I'm doomed" one too much in the last
days. Also the government of the 3rd world country I live in proposed
a thing that's gonna take away even more democracy, and I finally got
my hands on checking the thing itself. We're actually fucked. I'm
losing the last bits of hope that my life is ever gonna get better.

## 2020-03-18

We finally got told about the coronavirus and shit. Since yesterday,
we even have soap in the restrooms, but I have no idea why it wasn't
there in the first place. Some people (in my observation) still don't
use it. What a nasty fuckers. The classes aren't canceled though, so
I'll still have to suffer. Considering I'm not doing shit on them and
am tired as fuck, I'm probably gonna fail and get kicked the hell out,
which is bad news because I'm male, and this country has fucked up
mandatory military service. Even if I serve (and, of course, get
traumatized), I'll have absolutely no opportunity to become anyone in
my life. Overall, actively wishing to kill myself to end this misery,
but not knowing a good way to do so sucks, and it's been one of the
main reasons of me being in panic all the time for a while now. I, of
course, constantly give hints of this, sometimes not entirely
voluntarily, but no one gives a shit about each other, so I don't
expect help to ever arrive. Or do I even need and/or deserve it? Will
the help just introduce more problems?

## 2020-03-19

Pretty much nothing happened, and I still feel like shit. I have some
things to do on the weekend, but something tells me that not this time
again.
