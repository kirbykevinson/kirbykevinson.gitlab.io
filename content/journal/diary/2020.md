The ridiculousness of the educational program I have to follow made me
completety lose any will to live, and I had an insane panic attack in
the evening.

Shitcoding in Python temporarily lifted my mood. Also I found [a cool
song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G6p9xRxgYA).

I finally finished the website, which is great. Other than that, the
whole day I was trying not to blow up again because the 5-day-long
mental rape starts tomorrow, and I was mostly successful.

It actually wasn't that bad, but I felt sick as shit the whole day.

Everything was alright, except still being sick and not having quite
enough time to do all the stuff I'd planned. Also my website finally
doesn't suck as much and has an actual blog.

Still sick and still no time. Fuck.
