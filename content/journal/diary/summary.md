I might be wrong with some dates because I'm not very good at
correctly remembering things.

## 2002/2005

I don't remember anything.

## 2006/2012

All that's left in my memory are a couple of frames and some general
information like where I lived (absolute shitholes), what media I
consumed (random shit), and the fact that I was actively bullied. I
was into computers a lot, and, by the end of this period, I was a big
fan of Windows 8 and, I think, had already tried GNU/Linux. Also I had
a couple of really bad websites created, which were probably deleted a
long time ago by now.

## 2013/2015

I started making Minecraft videos on YouTube. I have no idea why. They
were fucking awful, and I decided to purge them all, but I kinda
regret this decision because it'd be funny to look at them now. I also
did a lot other weird shit and was bullied even more, which left my
mental health in ruins. No one gave enough shit to actually help me.

## 2016/2017

I actually got back into web development and made some [horrible
projects]; one of them happened to be [a video game], which was
created in a collaboration with a very good friend and which I kept
developing until early 2019, and another one happened to be [this
website]. Also I finally switched to GNU/Linux. At the same time, my
mental health got even worse, and everyone gave even less shit.

## 2018

My life hit the rock bottom, which led to me trying to eliminate as
much of it as possible by stopping talking to anyone, holding extreme
libright views, removing as much recorded online presence of me as
possible, and getting too deep down the software minimalism rabbit
hole. You can probably guess what effect all of this had on me. Also I
accidentally formed [my music taste] by watching a YouTube video about
future funk.

## 2019

Things got a little bit better, and I mostly got rid of the mindset I
created for myself in 2018. At the same time, for little reason, I
started recording my dreams and watched anime, which I suddenly got
into. The whole year passed very quickly.

## 2020

* I started fixing my personal issues, including ones with mental
  health.
* I finally figured out my sexuality and gender identity.
* This website became finally useful, and I started documenting every
  day of my life in this journal.

## 2021 (in progress)
