The first day, and it already sucks ass. I was assigned a 5 day long
task, but I did all of it today, so I can be bored as usual for the
rest of the week. The problem is that I have to make a report that I
did this task, which involves using Microsoft Word. This program is
driving me fucking insane.

A miracle happened and, with some help of my mom, I managed to halfass
the report. This shit is gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.

Guess what, my suffering is not over yet because I have to also make a
presentation. I can't express how fucking retarded this very idea is -
there's absolutely nothing to present. God, I hate my life so much. If
only there was an escape other than killing myself.

Another miracle happened and, with some help of my friend, I fixed the
report, but I still don't know what to do with the presentation. The
other problem is that my math situation is still not fixed, and I can
and most likely will get me kicked out. Please someone help.

I still don't know what to do with the presentation. Maybe I just need
to wait for another miracle.

Here's some cool music:

I did it. It's horrible, and I can't even imagine actually presenting
it, but I did it. The (non-remote) classes officially star tomorrow,
and I'm anxious as fuck. Not only I didn't get any rest on the summer
holidays, but also 2 of my least favorite subjects - math and PE - are
tomorrow. Please someone free me out of this misery.
