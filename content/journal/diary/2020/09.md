## 2020-09-01

The first day, and it already sucks ass. I was assigned a 5 day long
task, but I did all of it today, so I can be bored as usual for the
rest of the week. The problem is that I have to make a report that I
did this task, which involves using Microsoft Word. This program is
driving me fucking insane.
