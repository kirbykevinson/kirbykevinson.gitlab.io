The first day, and it already sucks ass. I was assigned a 5 day long
task, but I did all of it today, so I can be bored as usual for the
rest of the week. The problem is that I have to make a report that I
did this task, which involves using Microsoft Word. This program is
driving me fucking insane.

A miracle happened and, with some help of my mom, I managed to halfass
the report. This shit is gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.
