## 2020-08-01

My usual series of problems continues. The day was boring as fuck, but
I didn't do shit about it because I'm lazy and scared. Also my
overeating problem came back.

Like several days ago, I had another long distance walk. It wasn't as
long, so I didn't lose as many calories, but whatever, I tried my
best.

By the way, I've finally been informed about my diagnosis - [STPD]. I
tried to look up some info about it, but I'm still not sure how
relatable it is.
