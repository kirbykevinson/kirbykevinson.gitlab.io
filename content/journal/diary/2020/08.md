## 2020-08-01

My usual series of problems continues. The day was boring as fuck, but
I didn't do shit about it because I'm lazy and scared. Also my
overeating problem came back.

## 2020-08-02

Like several days ago, I had another long distance walk. It wasn't as
long, so I didn't lose as many calories, but whatever, I tried my
best.

By the way, I've finally been informed about my diagnosis - [STPD]. I
tried to look up some info about it, but I'm still not sure how
relatable it is.

Another boring day, which I tried to fix by watching a movie. Didn't
work so well.

The same as yesterday but more successful. Also I finally made a
backup of a project my friend and I were doing for a while. Here are
some good albums I've recently listened to:

* [Grover Washington Jr. - Winelight](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ls32JrfpXuFS3NfcIDOaIkNq480SPF0is)
* [sungazer - sungazer vol. I](https://sungazermusic.bandcamp.com/album/sungazer-vol-i)
* [sungazer - sungazer vol. 2](https://sungazermusic.bandcamp.com/album/sungazer-vol-2)
