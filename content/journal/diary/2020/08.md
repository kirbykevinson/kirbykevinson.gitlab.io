## 2020-08-01

My usual series of problems continues. The day was boring as fuck, but
I didn't do shit about it because I'm lazy and scared. Also my
overeating problem came back.

## 2020-08-02

Like several days ago, I had another long distance walk. It wasn't as
long, so I didn't lose as many calories, but whatever, I tried my
best.

By the way, I've finally been informed about my diagnosis - [STPD]. I
tried to look up some info about it, but I'm still not sure how
relatable it is.

Another boring day, which I tried to fix by watching a movie. Didn't
work so well.

The same as yesterday but more successful. Also I finally made a
backup of a project my friend and I were doing for a while. Here are
some good albums I've recently listened to:

* [Grover Washington Jr. - Winelight](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ls32JrfpXuFS3NfcIDOaIkNq480SPF0is)
* [sungazer - sungazer vol. I](https://sungazermusic.bandcamp.com/album/sungazer-vol-i)
* [sungazer - sungazer vol. 2](https://sungazermusic.bandcamp.com/album/sungazer-vol-2)

The day was a complete ass until I decided to take a nap. It wasn't so
easy because I ran out of my nasal spray and could barely breath, but
at least I felt so relaxed afterwards. I also had a choice to watch a
film instead, but I kinda got tired of them. Currently I'm thinking
of fasting for several days to get rid of some of my fat.

My relatives offered me to go swimming on an unregulated beach, and I
agreed this time. It was kinda cool. I wish I had enough balls to go
outside more.

## 2020-08-07

The weather suddenly got really bad, so I didn't go anywhere once
again. But at least I finally had my chair fixed. Also it turned out
it's more configurable than I thought, and I'm now desperately trying
to find the perfect configuration.

## 2020-08-08

I was invited once again, this time to a proper regulated beach. It
was alright, but I still didn't burn as many calories as I consumed.
Please help.

I was going to go to grandma to waste some time but ended up watching
quite possibly the best anime in my entire life. Good.
