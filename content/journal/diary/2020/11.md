## 2020-11-01

The only interesting thing planned for today was going shopping with
my mom. I was going to ask her to buy me some girl clothes but decided
not to until I'm out to her, which I hope I will be soon. Currently
I'm planning to do laser hair removal on my face.

## 2020-11-02

The coming out is happening on Wednesday, and the laser hair removal
is on Friday. Also it looks like we're studying remotely from
Wednesday until the end of the week. Very good.

An old friend of mine, which recently moved to a nearby bigger city,
absolutely unexpected invited me to a walk. We ended up going all the
way to the place I'm studying at, resulting with me walking over 19000
steps this day. The thing that surprised me the most was how much more
masculine he is now. Thank god it didn't happen to me :)

This was quite an eventful day. First, I came out to my mom, and
surprisingly, she's quite chill. We don't agree on some points and she
has doubts, but it's much better than nothing. Second, while I was
coming out, I sent the coming out file (which I'll probably publish
soon) to the second friend I came out to, and now he takes the whole
thing seriously. Great. Third, I shaved my legs for the first time
ever. I also bought an epilator but decided not to use it yet.

Now I'm not entire sure what to do with my transition, more
specifically hormones. I couldn't find information on if it's legal
and how to obtain E without a prescription, and it also seems like
self-medicating in this case is not the best option. I'll, of course,
schedule an appointment with my therapist, but knowing where I live,
I'm not sure if I'll make any progress.

## 2020-11-05

The appointment is scheduled on Monday. Currently I'm trying to battle
doubt (what if I'm not trans enough) and my mom, which is not entirely
sure that hormones is the best thing for me. I'm now kinda scared and
unsure if I'll succeed, but giving up is not an option.

Also, yeah, I'm back at my grandma's.

## 2020-11-06

For some reason I thought the laser would be today, but it's actually
tomorrow. I went home and was going to go back to grandma but decided
not to. I'm not sure if I'll attend the therapist because we're
studying on Monday and I'm not sure how to do it properly.

## 2020-11-07

The laser was canceled because of the drugs I take. Fucking
incredible. Also it was decided that it's better not to go to the
therapist on Monday because she's being replaced by another person
and there can be misunderstandings.

I forgot to mention, but I had planned to dye my hair today. My friend
offered her service, but I decided that my mom is more experienced.
That was probably a mistake. My hair in the end looks fine, but
somehow she just forgot to wear gloves, which were right in her
fucking face, and now her hands are black.
