## 2020-11-01

The only interesting thing planned for today was going shopping with
my mom. I was going to ask her to buy me some girl clothes but decided
not to until I'm out to her, which I hope I will be soon. Currently
I'm planning to do laser hair removal on my face.

The coming out is happening on Wednesday, and the laser hair removal
is on Friday. Also it looks like we're studying remotely from
Wednesday until the end of the week. Very good.
