## 2020-11-01

The only interesting thing planned for today was going shopping with
my mom. I was going to ask her to buy me some girl clothes but decided
not to until I'm out to her, which I hope I will be soon. Currently
I'm planning to do laser hair removal on my face.

The coming out is happening on Wednesday, and the laser hair removal
is on Friday. Also it looks like we're studying remotely from
Wednesday until the end of the week. Very good.

An old friend of mine, which recently moved to a nearby bigger city,
absolutely unexpected invited me to a walk. We ended up going all the
way to the place I'm studying at, resulting with me walking over 19000
steps this day. The thing that surprised me the most was how much more
masculine he is now. Thank god it didn't happen to me :)
