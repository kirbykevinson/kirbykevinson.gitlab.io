I had a doctor visit today. They prescribed me a better antidepressant
and scheduled a therapy session on Monday. I'm not sure what I'm gonna
say there, so I guess I'll make another list.

The exam was a complete miracle. Not only I managed to solve
everything I prepared for, but he also made me solve the task I didn't
know how to do, which I did in the end. He also gave me a good grade
in the end. God, life is worth living sometimes.
