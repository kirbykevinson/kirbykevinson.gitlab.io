## 2020-12-01

The shit yesterday hit so hard, it was still affecting me today. As a
result, I didn't do shit again.

I had an idea to publish some of my private text files, but it turned
out I don't have many of them, so I decided not to. I also had an even
more insane idea of replacing my todo list with a public GitLab issue
tracker, but it seems like if I do, I'll never look at it.
