## 2020-12-01

The shit yesterday hit so hard, it was still affecting me today. As a
result, I didn't do shit again.

I had an idea to publish some of my private text files, but it turned
out I don't have many of them, so I decided not to. I also had an even
more insane idea of replacing my todo list with a public GitLab issue
tracker, but it seems like if I do, I'll never look at it.

Update: I added a secret theme switcher to my website.

## 2020-12-02

For the third day in a row, we had a math class, and it seems like
it's gonna continue for at least 2 weeks. I hate my life. Today I
wasn't as lazy as yesterday and managed to make some progress on the
report, but it wasn't nearly enough.

## 2020-12-03

I decided not to make any more changes to the report and finally made
a presentation. It seems like we're presenting the next week, possibly
on Monday. Meanwhile math torture continues, and it's slowly making me
lose hope.

## 2020-12-04

About a year ago I had an idea to build a JSON-based markup language.
For some reason, I recently suddenly remembered it, and now I'll just
have to implement it. You can track my progress [here].

## 2020-12-05

I greatly overestimated my programming abilities - writing in such a
hellish language as C is a nightmare. But in any case, I somehow
managed to implement the serializer, improved the overall code
quality, and started writing the deserializer.

## 2020-12-06

Just as I expected, I finished implemeting the lexer. The last part
left is the parser, but it's the hardest one, and considering I don't
know how to implement it, I don't know how much time it can take me.
The weekend ends tomorrow, but I'll still probably have some time on
the classes to code. Wish me luck.

## 2020-12-07

I did have some time on the classes as I expected, and I spent it
implementing the core of the parser - the shit can now parse
primitives. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it because I suddenly
started feeling extremely drugged. I need to go to my doctor and
finally tell her about the drugs.

## 2020-12-08

I'm done implementing the parser! Now the only steps left are to
actually test it and tell everyone about it. Other than that, the day
wasn't as good. Our teacher says we're presenting the next Tuesday,
but I have absolutely no motivation whatsoever to fix my shit.

## 2020-12-09

The classes were pretty late today and there were only 2 of them, so I
ended up being one of only 2 people that attended. I had nothing to do
but play Game Boy games. Tomorrow the classes are just as useless as
today but not as late.

As I wanted to do, I published my programming idea list. I'm assuming
you already know where to look for it.

## 2020-12-10

I didn't sleep well today, so I ended up feeling kinda crappy. Not
much happened in terms of studying, so it's not much of an issue.

I made [an issue tracker for my life]. Yup, I did. Feel free to open
an issue.

God, I want to be a girl so much. I can't stop thinking about how
difficult it would be for me to actually be one in this country, and
it saddens me.

## 2020-12-11

I went to the doctor and told her about the feeling drugged problem.
She didn't prescribe a different drug and just told me to take them
differently. I hope it helps.

The jamtext project is currently doing fine. I fixed several bugs I've
found and now am planning to add a testing suite to the whole thing by
forking one for JSON.

## 2020-12-12

I spent the day trying to port [JSONTestSuite] for jamtext. Even
though the thing is messy as fuck, I kind of did it. Only after doing
it I realized that it makes no sense because there's only 1
implementation of jamtext, and it'd be a much better idea to just
write regular tests.

[JSONTestSuite]: https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/

## 2020-12-13

As I wanted, I wrote a set of regular unit tests. They suck, but some
tests are better than none.

Update: I also made the thing more portable by getting rid of
open\_memstream and fmemopen. It was painful.
