## 2021-04-01

Another productive day. Basically, the server of my project is ready.
The only feature I that I planned left is attachments. Everything else
just worksâ„¢ and doesn't seem to be too buggy. Also I finally switched
all of my CSS shit to `box-sizing: border-box;` because why not.

## 2021-04-02

Yup, one more productive day. I implemented attaching files for the
chat. Now the whole thing is basically done because I did everything I
planned. Some polishing is, of course, still required, but I guess it
wouldn't be too hard. What I'm currently afraid of is that now I won't
have anything to do again and will be even more bored that before. I
guess it then will be the right time to start playing video games and
watching anime.

## 2021-04-03

The exact thing I was afraid of happened. The day was boring. I had
absolutely nothing todo. Needless to say, I ate a lot of fast food
again. Did it help? No. I haven't started playing video games/watching
anime yet because I'm too lazy to start, but I guess I will soon
because there's not much choice.

Oh great. After another update, my GRUB got fucked up and I wasn't
able to boot my sistem. This is extremely weird because I did the same
update on my laptop and it didn't break. I suspect my motherboard
fucked up some EFI variable or something. In any case, all I had to do
was `sudo dnf reinstall grub2-efi-x64 shim-x64`, and now everything
works again. Also just before that, I found out about a bug in Mutter,
which I, of course, [reported]. God, I report so many bugs, I might as
well make a bug report journal.

[reported]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1736

Done, here's [the bug report journal].

It was a "meh" kind of day. Right after I woke up, my parents invited
me to go shopping for building materials. I had absolutely nothing
planned for the day, so I, of course, agreed. We ended up not bying a
single building material and one laundry basket. Yeah, and also a
shitton of food, which I ate. When I came home I was back into the
state of boredom right until the moment I decided to do something
about jamtext. I took me some time, but I finally fixed Unicode
parsing there. I used a custom UTF-8 encoding function, which I stole
from GitHub and, of course, credited. I planned to do the same thing
for number parsing/printing too, but it turned out there are no good
number printers that I can find. I decided to write one myself, and I
think I was successful. I'll just assume that it works perfectly until
someone finds a bug.

## 2021-04-05

We got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Just like I expected,
something got fucked up again. The doctor that was filling my papers
was barely alive and moved his fingers slower than sloth's shit. He
barely asked me any questions about my medical history, but luckily I
don't have anything harmful, and he did it so slow that my father that
entered after I did got out faster. And if that wasn't enough, he
wrote the entry in my vaccination certificate in the wrong place and
made a mistake in the date, and I had to go back so he corrected it.
*Sigh*. I'm not even sure if the shit he wrote is valid and whether
I'll be allowed to go abroad with it. In any case, the best I can do
now is hope.

The day was unexpectedly productive. A guy from discord suggested me
to add link highlighting to my chat. It was a good idea, so I did it,
but I didn't stop there. I decided to also add deleting and editing
messages. I had to rewrite the whole for it to work, but I did it. The
app is now an order of magnitude more complex, but I believe it was
worth it. Now when I'm at it, why don't I implement more features like
reactions from Discord? Well, we'll see how long I'll be able to keep
it up.

## 2021-04-06

Expectedly, I got sick. It wasn't as bad as the last time but still
annoying. In addition to that, I haven't taken a shower in like a
week, so I was really uncomfortable. I was trying my best to continue
improving the chat. I made some architectural changes, and even
attempted to add unlimited message history but failed. Well, I guess
another time.

## 2021-04-07

The day was disappointingly uneventful. We didn't attend the previous
2 days but today started attending again. I didn't do anything on the
"classes." One topic that I got to discuss with the groupmates is
vaccination. They say they refuse to vaccinate because they think the
government is lying to them. This is really bad news because if the
government fucked up so badly that people don't want to trust the
science, we're really in trouble. I'll, of course, stay optimistic and
hope that the vaccination campain goes well regardless and we as a
species can properly recover. In any case, when I got home, still
nothing happened. Even the English class got canceled. But at least
I'm not bored yet.

## 2021-04-08

I felt so meh I don't even feel like writing this entry. To be fair,
it wasn't as bad as the last summer, but still. Just like expected,
now I'm actually bored and extremely unwilling to do anything. I
brought my laptop to the classes as usual but ended up not using it a
single time. Apart from some actually fun conversations and games I've
done with my friends, I spent the entire time scrolling through
Reddit. In fact, I scrolled so far down that I was seeing posts with
no upvotes. The thoughts that weren't leaving my mind of my mind were
about how pathetic I am. While I'm here at college managing to not get
kicked out, everything's probably gonna be fine, but what's next? I've
hit the roof in terms of education I can get because I'm absolutely
terrible at getting through it, so chances are college education
(which if you don't know, is much different in Russia from what it is
in the US and is valued much less) is what I'm gonna end up with for
the rest of my life. Thus, it's highly likely that I'm gonna be stuck
in this shithole country that doesn't care about me and doesn't want
me to be myself for the rest of my life, and I just can't get over it.
And if that wasn't enough, as I mentioned countless times on this
website, I'm really shitty at working, so I highly question my ability
to get any job higher level than a McDonald's cashier. So what's the
point of it all then? Why should I bother living this live if it's
gonna be nothing but suffering? This is the exact question I should
ask to my psychologist, but I'm too lazy to even find time to schedule
an appointment with them because I'm constantly forgetting about it. I
mean come on, I'm too lazy to use escapism to my advantage by playing
Minecraft or watching anime because I just can't force myself to take
my ass of the bed and do the simplest thing ever. God, I hate myself.

*Sigh*. So today the teacher was taking a final look at our works
before they get presenting. My personal project worked just fine but
the group one required some tweaking. More specifically, my friend
forgot to put an error message in a place where it should be, leading
me to beilieve that there's a serious bug in the program. In the end,
we've got eveything sorted and the teacher accepted it. We got our
grades allegedly based on how good we performed our roles in the
roles, and that was about it for the classes - we spent the rest of
the time playing. Also he said that each one of us should make a
report of both the personal and the portion they contributed for the
group project by next Wednesday. And yeah, I forgot to mention, but
the personal project and the thesis are treated as 2 different things
despite not being them. That makes no sense, and we'll have to just
pretend, but I'm already used to things like this. The real question
here is how the fuck was it even legal to assign us 2 works at once. I
mean both of them would be really hard to do if we actually weren't
lazy and doing things, so I really don't know. In any case, making a
report doesn't seem like a really big problem for me, and I'm also
used to ignoring such logical problems, so I guess I shouldn't worry
too much. Well, I shouldn't worry much about college, but I still do
have the problem of boredom. So here's a promise: right after writing
this entry I'll start playing a video game or watching anime.

Today I had the first class of preparation to the English exams.
Somehow my English courses teacher wasn't notified of it, so she lost
me for some time. Unlike I expected, the classes took 160 minutes and
not 80, but they weren't actually boring. We talked about some quirks
of the exam and practiced a bit on mock tasks. Overall, not bad. When
I got home I continued my GNOME bug hunting. I provided some info on
the DMA-BUF screensharing bug and now am looking for participating in
its fix. I also recently had an idea to switch to X.org until Wayland
is in a better shape but decided to play smart. I configured my
Flatpak Qt apps and Firefox to properly work on both Wayland and X11
and also finally figured out how to do fractonal scaling on X.org. Now
I can use both windowing systems and switcb between them whenever I
want. Cool.

## 2021-04-11

I spent most of the day being bored and scared of what's gonna come
tomorrow (more college suffering). But closer to the evening, I took a
nice walk and played Minecraft with my friend. So overall, could be
worse.

## 2021-04-12

Nothing unexpected happened. Just like every other time, it was an
excruciating day that only reminded me of why I hate this place. And
guess what, I forgot to schedule an appointment with a psychologist
*again*, which is the exact thing I need now. In any case, the classes
were about as putrid as usual. First, we had English. The bitch didn't
teach us shit by using a prehistoric textbook and pretended that she's
a good teacher that does something. Like, you know, what she always
does. Then, we had "life safety" or whatever the fuck it's called in
English. We wrote 2 practical works and were given 2 more to write at
home. Of course I don't want to do shit and it's now only additional
pain in the ass. After that, we had P.E. I didn't even have my clothes
with me, so I didn't do shit the entire class.I was also forced to
write a little test, to which I wrote everything by guessing. Who
gives a shit. Last, we had 1C, on which I expected her to check my
works I was supposed to do on the practice. Unfortunately, she gave us
some technology quiz shit for grandmas, and we spent more than half of
the class for it. Not only she didn't check shit, but I also recieved
a score of 7/10 of computer literacy, including 6/10 for cyber
security. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm literally the most paranoid
person in the group. *Sigh*. So in the end, now I'm left with 2 1C
tasks to do until tomorrow, 1 bigass report to do until Wednesday,
which I haven't even started yet, and a terrible fucking mood.
Perfect. That's exactly what I expected from the first day of
studying. Fuck you, life, and your terrible jokes.

Yesterday I got an idea to implement scrolling speed setting in Mutter
by myself, and it made me constantly think about it for the rest of
this day. Right when I came to college, I got the news that we don't
only need a report but also a presentation, but it later also turned
out that the presentation has been postponed, so the things now are
not that bad. On the 1C classes I got time to only present her 7 for
10 of my works, and it was quite far from perfect because I didn't
know shit about what I was talking about. After 1C we had databases, I
was watching funny prank videos instead of actually doing anything,
and in the end the teacher just told me to go home and not waste her
time. Cool.

Okay so I took a deeper look into Mutter's code base, and oh boy, it's
complicated. It seems like I'll only be able to implement scrolling
speed for touchpads and not mouses, but I guess that's enough.

Okay, I give up. I implemented the setting itself but not a way to set
it yet. I guess I'll continue tomorrow.

My laptop's up arrow button started getting suck, and I thought my
monitor/GPU started dying because there was a random red line that
somehow vanished. Cool. That's the exact kind of thing I expected from
my life.
