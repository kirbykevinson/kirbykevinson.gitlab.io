## 2021-04-01

Another productive day. Basically, the server of my project is ready.
The only feature I that I planned left is attachments. Everything else
just worksâ„¢ and doesn't seem to be too buggy. Also I finally switched
all of my CSS shit to `box-sizing: border-box;` because why not.

Yup, one more productive day. I implemented attaching files for the
chat. Now the whole thing is basically done because I did everything I
planned. Some polishing is, of course, still required, but I guess it
wouldn't be too hard. What I'm currently afraid of is that now I won't
have anything to do again and will be even more bored that before. I
guess it then will be the right time to start playing video games and
watching anime.

The exact thing I was afraid of happened. The day was boring. I had
absolutely nothing todo. Needless to say, I ate a lot of fast food
again. Did it help? No. I haven't started playing video games/watching
anime yet because I'm too lazy to start, but I guess I will soon
because there's not much choice.
