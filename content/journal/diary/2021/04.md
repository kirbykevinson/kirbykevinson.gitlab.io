## 2021-04-01

Another productive day. Basically, the server of my project is ready.
The only feature I that I planned left is attachments. Everything else
just worksâ„¢ and doesn't seem to be too buggy. Also I finally switched
all of my CSS shit to `box-sizing: border-box;` because why not.

## 2021-04-02

Yup, one more productive day. I implemented attaching files for the
chat. Now the whole thing is basically done because I did everything I
planned. Some polishing is, of course, still required, but I guess it
wouldn't be too hard. What I'm currently afraid of is that now I won't
have anything to do again and will be even more bored that before. I
guess it then will be the right time to start playing video games and
watching anime.

The exact thing I was afraid of happened. The day was boring. I had
absolutely nothing todo. Needless to say, I ate a lot of fast food
again. Did it help? No. I haven't started playing video games/watching
anime yet because I'm too lazy to start, but I guess I will soon
because there's not much choice.

Oh great. After another update, my GRUB got fucked up and I wasn't
able to boot my sistem. This is extremely weird because I did the same
update on my laptop and it didn't break. I suspect my motherboard
fucked up some EFI variable or something. In any case, all I had to do
was `sudo dnf reinstall grub2-efi-x64 shim-x64`, and now everything
works again. Also just before that, I found out about a bug in Mutter,
which I, of course, [reported]. God, I report so many bugs, I might as
well make a bug report journal.

Done, here's [the bug report journal].

It was a "meh" kind of day. Right after I woke up, my parents invited
me to go shopping for building materials. I had absolutely nothing
planned for the day, so I, of course, agreed. We ended up not bying a
single building material and one laundry basket. Yeah, and also a
shitton of food, which I ate. When I came home I was back into the
state of boredom right until the moment I decided to do something
about jamtext. I took me some time, but I finally fixed Unicode
parsing there. I used a custom UTF-8 encoding function, which I stole
from GitHub and, of course, credited. I planned to do the same thing
for number parsing/printing too, but it turned out there are no good
number printers that I can find. I decided to write one myself, and I
think I was successful. I'll just assume that it works perfectly until
someone finds a bug.

We got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Just like I expected,
something got fucked up again. The doctor that was filling my papers
was barely alive and moved his fingers slower than sloth's shit. He
barely asked me any questions about my medical history, but luckily I
don't have anything harmful, and he did it so slow that my father that
entered after I did got out faster. And if that wasn't enough, he
wrote the entry in my vaccination certificate in the wrong place and
made a mistake in the date, and I had to go back so he corrected it.
*Sigh*. I'm not even sure if the shit he wrote is valid and whether
I'll be allowed to go abroad with it. In any case, the best I can do
now is hope.

The day was unexpectedly productive. A guy from discord suggested me
to add link highlighting to my chat. It was a good idea, so I did it,
but I didn't stop there. I decided to also add deleting and editing
messages. I had to rewrite the whole for it to work, but I did it. The
app is now an order of magnitude more complex, but I believe it was
worth it. Now when I'm at it, why don't I implement more features like
reactions from Discord? Well, we'll see how long I'll be able to keep
it up.

Expectedly, I got sick. It wasn't as bad as the last time but still
annoying. In addition to that, I haven't taken a shower in like a
week, so I was really uncomfortable. I was trying my best to continue
improving the chat. I made some architectural changes, and even
attempted to add unlimited message history but failed. Well, I guess
another time.
