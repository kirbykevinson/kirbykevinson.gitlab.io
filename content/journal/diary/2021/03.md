The psychologist session didn't go... at all. We spent about half an
hour talking about what we're supposed to talk about and made jack
shit out of it. She accuses me of "having nothing to talk about," but
how the fuck am I supposed to know what to talk about? You're the
specialist here and not me, bitch. I was desperately trying to ask
what I'm supposed to do now, but she just told me to "come back when I
have something to talk about." Are you fucking kidding me? How the
hell do you expect to find something you need to me say? In the end,
we just agreed that she isn't compatible with me as a specialist and
that I need to look for another psychologist. Fucking incredible. I
just wasted a fucking month of my life just to end up with a shithead
not understanding me. I won't be surprised if a different therapist
will give me another 600 question test and do nothing to actually help
me. God, I fucking hate this country. Why can't they just be
straightforward and do what they're supposed to?

The classes were about as crappy as usual. For the first time since
forever I got a bad grade on English because I didn't learn anything.
The teacher was trying to mock me for that, but good luck I stopped
giving a shit about my grades a long time ago. What however I didn't
stop giving a shit is the psychiatrist fiasco that happened today. In
other words, my day was fucking ruined. I tried to fix it by
overeating but did it too much - I ended up eating 3 hamburgers and 1
sandwich. My stomach is dying now.

Yesterday had a pretty rough end. I was completely demoralized by how
terrible the day was, so the only thing I was thinking about while in
bed was how I'm never gonna be myself because none of those
psychologists could possibly be competent. While I was doing that, I
forgot to take the drugs, so I ended up barely sleeping again. I woke
up feeling like a corpse that really wants to sleep but just can't.
The fact that we'd have 2 of horrible 1C classes and I wouldn't be
able to send my P.E. shit because the classes were going to start too
late didn't do me a favor. But to my surprise, the rest of the day was
not that bad. I adapted to being sleepy and now even kinda enjoy it.
It turned out that we were not having 1C classes but databases
instead. This saved me quite some headache because I could allow
myself not to do shit for the whole time. Specifically, I made a
website for my another groupmate. It sucks, but it's not my fault
because I was just following his instructions. After the classes, we
had a usual KFC visit, where I ate (this time, only) one burger.

I finished watching One Punch Man yesterday, so the whole day I
couldn't get rid of the thoughts about it. Also I felt kinda week,
which is probably because I was too excited yesterday. Today we had 5
classes, 1 of which was 1C and 4 of which was application programming.
Who the fuck even makes up schedules like that? Is it even legal? In
any case, I tried to hand my P.E. shit to the teacher, but it turned
out I had to actually prepare for it, so now I'll have to make up some
questions to answer. Well, she already waited for 2 months, so she can
wait another 2.

I added comments to some blogs entries. Well, kinda - they're just
links to Hacker News, Reddit, or wherever I published the shit. Now
everything will hopefully be more engaging.

The appointment went about as well as I expected. First, we talked
about the side effects of the drugs, but I couldn't explain it well
enough, so the next time I'll have to come with my mom. I mean it's
her who has complains about my grugged behavior, not me. Then I told
her about the psychologist fiasco, and she gave me a token for another
one. She told me to come to a specific psychologist, which is, as she
says, the most skilled because she's the main one. While I was waiting
for her to finish lunch, I was told that my old psychologist already
made some summary about me and that I should hand it over to the
doctor that was replacing mine the previous time or something. In the
end, it turned out to be just a mistake, and I didn't have to do
anything. When she finished lunch, we scheduled an appointment on
March 18th. By her looks and the fact that she already managed to be
rude in those 30 seconds that I've seen her, I don't expect much from
her. She's reportedly more skilled, so I hope that our conversation
will go a little bit further than with that one. In any case, I'm
ready to accept that I'm losing month of my life again. Even if I
don't manage to get an HRT prescription from them, I always have an
option to take the drugs ilegally. So, yeah, I'm currently not
worrying too much about it.

I had an opportunity to skip all of the classes but decided not. There
were 2 classes of damned 1C, the second of which I had time to attend.
To my luck, we didn't have to do anything practical. Nothing out of
ordinary happened after the classes. I didn't plan to do anything
today and didn't do anything in the end. Do I feel bad about it?
Maybe.

My birthday is tomorrow, but we decided to celebrate it today because
it was much easier to meet each other. I invited 4 of my friends and
my sister. The latter had problems with getting to the place, so I
sort of regret inviting her. But on the bright side, we had a nice
long walk because of that, so why not. The 6 of us went to KFC, where
we spent about 2000 rubles in total. Not that much really, and we were
all quite satisfied with it. After that my sister and I went to the
cinema. Our father agreed to take us back home, but we forgot to tell
him that we went to a different mall, so there were some problems with
that. Oh well.

My todo list is not getting much smaller. Recently I finally fixed
[that one bug] with libinput-config, but other than that I still have
a lot of things to do. Most of them are college stuff, which I'm
really lazy to do. It's not like I have a choice not to do anything,
so I guess everything will be done sometime.

[that one bug]: https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/libinput-config/-/issues/4

In the morning I had a standard kind of negative thought I usually
have. I'm already 19 and I haven't even started hormones yet + the
rest of my life is probably going to suck because I can't even take a
Russian college. But, you know, fuck those thoughts. It's my damn
birthday now, so I'm free to enjoy blissful ignorance while I can.

Not much happened compared to yesterday. In the morning I had a usual
English class, and it was better than usual. We had quite some talk,
the tasks were actually interesting to do, and overall we had a lot of
fun. When I got back home, some relatives came to us to celebrate my
birthday. I didn't stay there for to long though because my sister and
I went to the cinema shortly after. Just like yesterday, we spent a
shitton of money, but this time the movie was shittier and we could
barely get our seats. But in the end, we still enjoyed it, so
whatever.

## 2021-03-07

Even fewer things happened than yesterday. I spent half of the day
sleeping or trying to fall back asleep. When I finally woke up my
sister invited me to go shopping. I wanted to decline at first but
agreed in the end because I had nothing to do today in any case. We
bought some clothes for her and ate some KFC shit as usual. I also
wanted to buy some girl clothes for me but she didn't want to do that
and I didn't feel great because of not taking a shower for several
days, so we decided to also go shopping tomorrow.

I just couldn't resist and bought another domain - bruh.ltd. Paying
for 3 domains is a little too much, so I decided to disable auto
renewal on transbian.club, thus losing only 3 bucks overall. I already
have an idea what to put there - a fake corporate website that's
comically unusable. I also wanted to make the root and the www
versions of the website separate, but that turned out to be impossible
with Neocities even using advanced hackery.

## 2021-03-08

It was the 4th day in a row of my birthday celebration. As promised,
we did go shopping and ended up eating just as much food as yesterday.
I bought myself new leggings and a nice hoodie, but I couldn't find
any skirts that go spinny and any sports bras that can fit my
shoulders. Probably I'll have to order them online. When I came back
home I realized that I'm a fucking idiot and I put a CNAME on the root
of my domain name, and that's why it wasn't working. I'm so angry at
myself for not noticing it and just wasting time. After that, my
friend and I decided to play Minecraft, but he couldn't install the
server nor he could connect to mine. Sad.

## 2021-03-09

The holidays are over, thus the nightmare is continued. The classes
weren't too unusual, but I still felt like shit. I was trying to force
myself to work on the newly created website, on which I'm now also
planning to put my secret pages, but failed. On the last class I was
reminded that I still haven't done the P.E. shit, and now I'll have to
attend the teacher tomorrow. I greatly question if I can actually do
everything they need from me until tomorrow. So, yeah, my motivation
is still as low as it can get, and P.E. is by far not the only thing I
should worry about. Another problem I've recently been thinking about
is my transition. I'm seeing countless cases of people being rejected
HRT because of their sexuality or lack of stereotipical stuff, and
considering how far behind this country is in terms of LGBT issues,
I'm getting only more and more sure that I'll have to do DIY.

Great, now I also feel drugged. Thanks, life, that's exactly what I
needed.
