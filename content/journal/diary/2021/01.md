This was going to be another uneventful day, but I ended up taking a
nap for too long and sleeping throughout the whole day. I hope it
didn't fuck up my sleeping schedule again.

I went to my grandma. That's about it.

I spent the day watching weird YouTube videos. Notable examples
include [That Japanese Man Yuta] \(no I'm not slowly becoming a
weeaboo, it's just for scientific purposes) and [NFKRZ]. The second
one is pretty interesting because he reminds me of how relatively good
but still imperfect my English is and how I'm degrading day by day
because of not enough practice. I mean whatever :)

I'm back from my grandma. That's about it.

Today I finally managed to talk to some people, this time on the
Neocities discord server. Feels good man. God, I'm so lonely.

I forgot to mention it, but we're planning to move to the center of
the city. We actually already bought an apartment and are going to
sell this one when we've moved. Today we were bying things needed to
repair the whole thing to a presentable state, including amazing
ＢＲＩＣＣ wallpapers for my room. I visited the apartment for the
first time today, and I have to say it currently looks like a bad
soviet fever dream. Luckily, this time, we won't have to put much
effort into repairing it because we hired a bunch of guys to do things
for us.
