## 2021-01-01

This was going to be another uneventful day, but I ended up taking a
nap for too long and sleeping throughout the whole day. I hope it
didn't fuck up my sleeping schedule again.

## 2021-01-02

I went to my grandma. That's about it.

## 2021-01-03

I spent the day watching weird YouTube videos. Notable examples
include [That Japanese Man Yuta] \(no I'm not slowly becoming a
weeaboo, it's just for scientific purposes) and [NFKRZ]. The second
one is pretty interesting because he reminds me of how relatively good
but still imperfect my English is and how I'm degrading day by day
because of not enough practice. I mean whatever :)

## 2021-01-04

I'm back from my grandma. That's about it.

Today I finally managed to talk to some people, this time on the
Neocities discord server. Feels good man. God, I'm so lonely.

## 2021-01-05

I forgot to mention it, but we're planning to move to the center of
the city. We actually already bought an apartment and are going to
sell this one when we've moved. Today we were bying things needed to
repair the whole thing to a presentable state, including amazing
ＢＲＩＣＣ wallpapers for my room. I visited the apartment for the
first time today, and I have to say it currently looks like a bad
soviet fever dream. Luckily, this time, we won't have to put much
effort into repairing it because we hired a bunch of guys to do things
for us.

## 2021-01-06

We bought some lighting equipment for out future home. That's about it
for the day, but it's not like we had anything else planned.

## 2021-01-07

We spent the day demolishing the insides of the apartment so it can be
renovated later. In contrast to what I thought, it absolutely wasn't
fun, and we also barely made any progress. Most of the wooden stuff
and wallpapers have already been destroyed, but everything else,
including the old ass soviet floors, is still there. One funny thing
that happened is how we had to lift 4 rolls of floor material via the
window because it was too wide to fit the staircase. Unfortunately I
couldn't help them with that, so some random guy from the street did.
I'm not sure how the guys we invited are going to unwrap the whole
thing, but I guess it's not our problem.

## 2021-01-08

I decided to not to go the place today and leave my parents alone.
They didn't mind it, and I hope they did well today. Instead I did
nothing as usual and also finally came up with a solution to my broken
touchpad - [libinput-touchpad-scroll-fix]. I hope it'll be useful to
more than just me.

[libinput-touchpad-scroll-fix]: https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/libinput-touchpad-scroll-fix

Update: nope, they didn't do well. Not only the barely made any
progress, it also turned out that the walls inside of the apartment
are soviet cardboard crap, and now they're going to destroy *every*
***single*** ｗａｌｌ there. Holy shit.

## 2021-01-09

Uhhh, not much happened. I had the first English class this year. It
was alright (meaning I got another chance to talk in English to actual
human beings) except the fact that I didn't do the homework again. My
parents were meanwhile continuing with wall destruction. I'm not sure
how they're dealing with the construction waste.

## 2021-01-10

I was forced to go with them this time. It turned out destroying walls
produces much more waste than I expected. We managed to get rid of 2
out of 3 piles of waste, but the last one is bigger than the other 2
combined. It seems reasonable to assume that we won't be able to get
rid of it on time, but my parents are very optimistic in this regard
for some reason. Tomorrow 3 more walls are going to be destroyed, but
I hope it won't involve me this time as I'm tired as fuck.

## 2021-01-11

Yup, I didn't have to be there. Do I feel bad about doing so? Probably
yes, but whatever, I had enough yesterday and they could manage
everything, so I guess it's not that bad. In any case, it was mostly
another day of desperately trying to find something to do. As usual, I
was falling back to watching YouTube videos. Maybe I need to finally
program something.

## 2021-01-12

The winter break is over; this was the first day of the torture
continuation. As I expected, the subjects didn't get any better, and
we're still learning God knows what. The phrase that kinda surprised
me was from our new teacher - "only 30% of the students passed this
exam last year, so the chances are you probably won't pass." What kind
of bullshit is that? This is literally unmasked taking my hope of a
better future away. Thank you, asshole, that was very inspiring. I
want to kill myself.

Recently I started reading about the recent Mozilla controversy with
their latest deplatforming blogpost. I'm not sure what opinion to have
on it. I'm not too competent in politics, especially in US ones, which
are messy as hell with both sides doing ridiculous shit. Only one
thing is certain - this shit will be yet another hit to their
reputation regardless of whether they're right or not. Even though it
hurts, I'll continue reading about the topic, and hopefully I'll form
an opinion sometime.

I acknowledge that by doing so, I'll be in a dangerous position, but
I'll attempt to write down my thoughts on this later in form of a
list.

By the way, if you're reading this and you want to talk to me about
the thing, please mind that my email is open for you.

Okay, here we go:

* I don't see their decision to be political as a necessarily bad
  thing. While it's true that staying out of politics is a great
  business decision, disclosing your true political motivations, which
  you of course have because everything is inheritely political, is
  great for transparency.
* I do support free speech, but I acknowledge that it's not free of
  consequences and doesn't mean a guarantee of a certain way of it to
  be presented.
* It seems reasonable to me to expect private compaines to have
  control over what not to allow on their platform, including hate
  speech.
* While, as far as I'm aware, deplatforming seems to be working, I'm
  not sure of how good and ethical of a solution it is, how deep we
  should allow it to happen, and whether it would produce unwanted
  side effects such as corporate censorship.
* I do still support decentralization despite it making harder to
  deplatform things as it's highly benifitical for the democracy and
  resisting monopolization.

## 2021-01-13

The second day of torture. Even more useless subjects were introduced.
As we were told, the exams are going to be even more insane than for
that subject, and I seriously doubt that I can pass. I seriously need
help.

Yesterday I had a little bit of a debate on a Discord server called
Equality. We discussed the whole Mozilla situation, and here are my
thoughts afterwards. The recent Twitter ban of Donald Trump can be
justified because Twitter doesn't qualify as an essential service,
thus it can police its content as it pleases. The recent AWS ban of
Parler is, however, not so simple. I'm not sure if a cloud service
provider qualifies as an essential service like, for example, light
and running water are, so their decision is ethically questionable.
Also I'm still not sure if deplatforming is good solution after all.

## 2021-01-14

Were were supposed to have 2 classes today, the latter of which would
be P.E., but ended up having only the first one. That's about the only
thing stopping this day from being awful. I feel kinda dead inside. I
know things are not going to ever get better, and it saddens me.

Another groupmate discovered my website. Here's a hello in case you're
reading this.

## 2021-01-15

The day wasn't quite as good as I wanted. We had 4 classes today, and
I felt pretty terrible on them. My studying abilities are getting only
worse and worse each day, so I'm not sure how I'm going to survive
this year. Thank god overeating helps a bit in terms of the mood.

So, yeah, I'm still not sure about that Mozilla thing. I need to talk
to more people about the whole censorship thing.

## 2021-01-16

Wow, a weekend and it wasn't even boring? What a miracle!

Instead of worrying about politics, I now worry about whether the
release of GNOME 40 is going to be a disaster. Great.

I decided that libinput-touchpad-scroll-fix is not enough and started
developing libinput-config. It does exactly what you expect -
configures libinput. It would be very cool if I didn't have to develop
it and the libinput guys just added a config themselves, but we have
what we have.

Update: [here you go](https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/libinput-config).

## 2021-01-17

If yesterday was okay, how come today was boring as fuck? Also where
did my enjoyment of my accomplishment go? And in addition to all of
that, why was I so fucking hungry? Come on, life, that's not what I
wanted from you.

## 2021-01-18

It was a sort of rough start of the week - we had 4 classes. I spent
most of them being hungry and thinking about food. I did get a chance
to it in the end - I tried a vegan shawarma for the first time.
Instead of chicken, it had mushrooms, and I have to say, I couldn't
even tell the difference. I'm pretty satisfied with it and I might
even buy it from on now.

libinput-config seems to be doing really fine. I got 2.5 likes on my
bug report comment, 2 GitLab stars, and even 1 fork. I also added a
pointer speed setting, which I forgot to add before.

Update: I forgot to mention, but my grandma is selling her apartment
and moving to us. Today we were transporting her stuff to our new
apartment. By the way, apparently libinput-config also got 1 issue,
where a guy couldn't compile the thing because of the old meson
version. Brilliant.

## 2021-01-19

nigga i feel so drugged

i just can't write down my thoughts

basically the things were better before because i could handle most of
the days

like we only rarely had subjects on which i couldn't literally
understand shit but now they're everyday

oh god please help me

i don't know how to even describe this drugged feeling

like right i have problems concentrating but that's not just it

i can barely put my thoughts into words

like my thoughts are falling apart

i don't know if that even makes sense

in any case that's it for the day i need to take a rest

okay fuck it here's some more info

by concentrating i mean being able to focus visually

which i do have problems with

but i also have problems with focusing in terms of sounds

like i'm not able to understand what's being said

and at the same time not being able to say something in response

sounds cool right

well it fucking isn't

## 2021-01-20

libinput-config started recieving a shitton of issues. I'm not sure if
I should be happy or not. On one hand, it cool that someone is
actually using my stuff, but on the other hand, now I also have to
worry not only about my life but also my creations. I'm not sure
what's the proportion of people who successfully used my hack to ones
who didn't, but the latter ones have some really interesting stuff
happening on their computers. I'm, of course, trying my best to help
them, and I hope the issues will be resolved at some point.

## 2021-01-21

Today we had 0 classes. What a blessing.

I made a bad mistake by deciding to debate date formats on a political
Discord server. People certainly didn't agree with my opinion, but
since it was a fun light-hearted conversation rather than a proper
debate (the channel was even called stupid debates), I don't consider
myself losing. But in any case, now this shit is stuck in my head. The
effect is similar to one when I watch a really great anime and can't
stop thinking about it for the next several days. Why can't my brain
just get over the fact that people may have different opinions?
Considering I'm transgender, I should've done it a long time ago. In
any case, please help me.

I've recently got a really weird idea of ranking all of my groupmates
in terms of sexual attractiveness in a list. By the time you see this
entry on my website, I've probably already done it, but for obvious
reasons, I can't share it with you.

## 2021-01-22

I felt pretty crappy. I just don't feel like living anymore, and I
don't know what to do about it. The situation is additionally worsened
by the fact that we're studying tomorrow when we usually don't.
Apparently it's because a protest will be taking place, and they want
to prevent people from going there. That's fucked up.

## 2021-01-23

For one reason or another, most of people decided not to attend the
classes, but I did. The protest did happen and I've even seen a bit of
it out of the window. My dad had to deliver me home so the police
doesn't mistake me for a protester. Before he did, though, I was going
to a shawarma shop by a different route, and luckily no one mistaked
me. Also regarding shawarma, I think I spend too much money on it. I
think I need a better diet.

libinput-config keeps accumulating issues and some popularity. Good.

## 2021-01-24

I spent the day working on my Linux rice, or to be exact, eliminating
as much of it as possible and falling back to the defaults. As an
icing on the cake, I also decided to switch to GNOME from Sway, and
I'm currently in progress of reinstalling the OS on my PC.

## 2021-01-25

Switching to GNOME was a pretty interesting decision. In other words,
I kinda regret doing it. I've detected several really unusual bugs
involving [hotkeys], one of which I didn't document yet, [the
screenshooter], and the sound applet, which I also didn't document
yet. We'll see how it goes on from here.

[hotkeys]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/3617 "Some keyboard shortcuts don't work when the shell is launched not via the display server"
[the screenshooter]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/3618 "The built-in screenshot utility doesn't work: Failed to save a screenshot: Timeout was reached"

## 2021-01-26

Should I switch back to Sway? Should I not? I don't know. In any case,
it was another day of mindless studying. The things are going well so
far because we don't have any assignments, but I guess, it's gonna get
fucked up soon.

## 2021-01-27

Yup, my guess was pretty good, everything already started going ape
shit. As you can guess, I'm not doing so well. While not being
particularly sad, I just feel empty inside. The realization of the
fact that I'm very likely not to survive this semester because of my
complete inability to study and the resulting consequences of being
useless in the society messes with my brain. I feel like I should just
kill myself because this is the only way out of this misery. Right now
it'd be very cool if things not related to studying (including
antidepressants) actually helped me.

I managed to convince the circle of my friends to take the BDSM test.
Very good. [Here are my results]. They're probably not the most
accurate, but sure the test tried its best.

[Here are my results]: https://bdsmtest.org/r/LLEsWtbF

## 2021-01-28

I just don't see a reason to be alive anymore. It's incredibly obvious
that I'll never feel good, so why should I even bother living this
life?

I forgot to mention, but I bought the transbian.club domain. I'm not
sure why because I still haven't found what to do with it.
