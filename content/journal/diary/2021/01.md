This was going to be another uneventful day, but I ended up taking a
nap for too long and sleeping throughout the whole day. I hope it
didn't fuck up my sleeping schedule again.

I went to my grandma. That's about it.

I spent the day watching weird YouTube videos. Notable examples
include [That Japanese Man Yuta] \(no I'm not slowly becoming a
weeaboo, it's just for scientific purposes) and [NFKRZ]. The second
one is pretty interesting because he reminds me of how relatively good
but still imperfect my English is and how I'm degrading day by day
because of not enough practice. I mean whatever :)
