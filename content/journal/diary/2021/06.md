## 2021-06-01

The first day of the summer, huh? My groupmates shared a schedule for
this month with me today, and as far as I understand, we'll have exams
and thesis presentation really really soon, and then there's gonna be
another practice. As I mentioned previously, I ran out of college
non-related things to do (or so I thought because I still have a
couple of extremely minor things to do), and I've been unsuccessfully
trying to start doing anything today. My friend is trying to help me
as much as possible, which I'm thankful for, but I still can't just
lift my ass. Our curator (honestly, I have no idea how it's called in
English, so let's pretend it's an appropriately applicable term)
called me today and was like "hey are you doing anything?" It was
extremely uncomfortable as usual, and we also scheduled a WhatsApp
call with her, my mom, and I, which is gonna happen so, but it's
probably gonna be as shitty as usual, so I likely won't even bother to
write about. The most realistic thing I can do right now is probably
databases, so I guess I know what to begin with.

So regarding my personal stuff, I did do a little bit minor. I cleaned
up the GitLab pipelines for my website, which cleaned over 500 MB of
space. I also cleaned up enabled features for my repos and removed a
project which didn't deserve a repo.

I've been recently questioning my religiousness. I say on my about
section that I'm an atheist, but am I really? I mean I do sort of
believe that the universe was created but don't believe in one
specific god. Does this count? Also I've had solipsistic thoughts too.
The main problem is just I can't grasp the concept of consciousness.
Why does this body have to be a vessel for my thoughts? My perception
of reality heavily depends on how this body functions biologically, so
why can't it just function on itself without involving *me*? I just
can't understand why I have to be a protagonist of some story. For
this reason, I have quite some doubts about whether other people
actually exist and whether they're like me. In any case, thinking
about it makes no sense because solipsism is unfalsifiable and whether
anything exists makes no practical difference, so I don't know why I
even waste my time on it.

## 2021-06-02

Some progress has been made - I've successfully passed life safety.
All I had to do was one little work and a couple of test, on which the
teacher barely even looked. One task less, I guess. Other than that, I
spent the day trying to find college non-related stuff to do, doing
nothing, and learning the Wayland protocol for educational purposes.
Currently I have an idea to write a toy graphics toolkit/layout engine
and maybe make a video game based on it. Considering I'm using C, that
would be a quite challeging task to accomplish. By the way, I forgot
to mention, but my parents and I were kinda thinking about buying me
an apartment, which would solve the moving out problem, and it seems
like the things are going in the right direction - my dad says his
loan was approved, and they already reserved the apartment. Now we
only have to wait until it's built and renovated somehow.

## 2021-06-03

The progress has stopped. I couldn't do anything today. Additionally,
I felt like shit. I suspect this can be because of the weather. The
exams start really soon (and I even thought we had one today), and I
think this time I could be not as lucky and get my ass slapped just as
I deserve. For my personal projects, I barely did anything - I finally
made a simple web page our programming teacher told me to do (as far
as I remember at least) and made a few adjustments for jamtext. I
think the latter can be released soon.

Okay, so today I had the second clinic visit of this week. Not much
happened except they lowered my antidepressant for some reason and the
fact that the therapist is going on a vacation, so they'll probably
replace her with another person. I went back home on foot once again
by a route I took the first time I did such a thing, and it felt much
easier than that time. Tomorrow we have a databases exam, and guess
what, my preparation is not going well. There are, like, 50 questions
to prepare for, and less than a half of them are related to SQL
(programming). So far I had one round of googling the answers, and I
wouldn't say it helped much. I feel kinda hopeless, but it's still
important that I mustn't let my laziness win, so I guess I'll keep
trying to start another round.

## 2021-06-05

Well, the exam didn't go quite as well as I expected. I spent my way
to college anxiously preparing to the worst question torture possible,
but the exactly opposite happened. There were only 2 questions, and
there were quite easy, but I still managed to fuck up. As I have or
haven't mentioned, I haven't been doing the large task we were
assigned some time ago, and she decided that what I did wasn't enough
to even deserve a C, I should do the task and present it to her. I've
got time only until Monday, and these two days are not quite enough
for me. I have other exams to prepare for, and we also have a thesis
presentation soon, to which I'm currently absolutely unprepared, but I
guess I have no choice. Currently I sort of did the task itself, and
now I need to test if it actually works in production and write a
report, the latter of which I'm planning to do by stealing from my
friend. As you might know, I work poorly even under minimal pressure,
so you probably know how I feel right now.

## 2021-06-06

Thanks to my dearest friend, I did manage to fix the report. But
there's still one little problem - it fucking sucks. This report is by
far the worst one I've ever made, and I can only hope that the teacher
accepts it. But still, I spent the whole day on it. Tomorrow we have a
programming exam, and according to our teacher, it's gonna be pretty
easy, so I'm not worrying about it.

As a reward for making the report, my mom promised me some sushi,
which I did get. I also bought a can of condensed milk later, which I
ate in a single take. That's pretty fucked up. While going to the
mall, my mom and I discussed what we're going to do with my new
apartment. For obvious reasons, I won't be able to renovate it myself,
so we settled on hiring someone even though it's expensive. She also
had some stupid ideas like inviting my friends to do it, but let's not
talk about them. We also discussed what I'm gonna do with my life and
didn't get anywhere once again. None of us could come up with a
reasonable occupation for me that would give me money and that I'd
actually want to do. I need to mention that to my new therapist. Also
my mom told me that I should mention how I theatened to beat up my
grandma after she accused me of doing nothing because apparently
that's dangerous. Whatever.

## 2021-06-07

The bitch refused to take my work. Yes, I am not kidding. She
*literally* told me that she wants to torture me a bit, so I have to
wait until September. This was just heartbreaking, and I got so mad I
wanted to slap her as hard as possible so she never walks again.
*Sigh*. In any case, we have a thesis presentation in 2 days, so I
spent the rest of the day trying my best not to fuck up and deliver
everything on time. So far I've been doing great.

## 2021-06-08

I spent the whole day doing the fucking thesis. Also my doctor wants
me to stop taking antidepressants soon. That's about it.

## 2021-06-09

I've finally did what I'd been meticulously preparing for over 2 days
\- presented my thesis. I didn't expect anything to go wrong, and
luckily, nothing did. The presentation itself went flawlessly, and no
one even looked at my report, so there were no complaints yet. By the
way, I was the only one to wrap the whole shit in punched pockets and
a folder. The teacher allowed us to leave after presenting, but I
waited for a while to ask some stupid questions to the presenters and
wait for my friends. I spend the rest of the day getting some
long-awaited rest. However, it's not the right time to fully relax as
we have another exam in just 2 days. I don't know shit about the
subject it's about, but you know, I'm optimistic. I'm just gonna do it
somehow. Am I more stupid than everyone else? Surely not.

## 2021-06-10

Today our curator politely invited me to the database teacher to solve
my shit. Fortunately, everything went even more fine than I expected.
She made me solve a couple of easy practical SQL tasks, out of which I
couldn't do only one, and I got a B in the end. It took me some time
to find my record-book, but otherwise that was it. While I was
searching for it, I also found the schedule for tomorrow's exam, which
no one else could find. Regarding the exam itself though, I'm not as
sure as yesterday now. While we would be given an additional test that
will potentially lower our risks of fucking up, I still don't know
shit about the subjects. I need to at least read the answers to the
exam questions once, but I can't force myself to.

## 2021-06-11

Today was the last exam of this year. Thank God. The exam itself went
pretty rough though. Right of the bat, I fucked up and forgot my very
important copybook, so I had to spend 2 hours going back home just to
take it. Then I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time until the
teacher comes back. When she did come, she asked me like "do you want
an A, a B, or a C?" I, of course, answered that I'd be glad if I got a
3, so she gave me a 10-question test. I tried my best answering it
randomly, and then I had to spend another 6 years waiting until she
checks everything. She announced that I indeed got a C, and I was
pretty much okay with it. Just when I started going out of the
college, I suddenly noticed that I forgot my phone, so I had to run 4
floors back up to take it. After that, I was finally free. As you can
expect, I celebrated this occasion by eating a shitton of food and
updating my website. Specifically, I finally added a description to
every page by uising Hugo hacks, so now Google and Discord will
display proper thumbnails.

## 2021-06-12

My mom's friends recently arrived in our city, so I was kindly invited
to go hang out with them. I fell asleep pretty late, so I had to
decline and spend half of the day sleeping. When I did wake up, I did
quite a few minor updates to my website. I didn't do all of the ones I
planned, but whatever. While I was doing all of that, the guys were at
a swimming pool, and now thinking about it I'm kinda jealous. At about
3 or 4 PM they went to our house and invited me once again, and I
agreed this time. I was also asked to take my laptop charger because
they forgot theirs, but it later turned out that they (expectedly) had
an incompatible with mine laptop model. After a short stay in our
apartment, the trip finally began. First, they drove us to their
apartment, which they rented for a couple of days. The apartment is
located in the center of the city, which is a pretty good place for a
walk, so it's perfectly understandable why we went there. After that,
we went to a nearby cafe and I and ate a shitton of food. I alone ate
a full-scale Italian pizza, a shawarma, and several sushi rolls. Not
only I consumed several thousand calories, my stomach got heavily
bloated for the rest of the day, which made my life much harder. While
we were waiting for our food, I manged to show my websites to them,
and it also turned out that one of them also had a website like 15
years ago. Also I somehow forgot to put some money on my credit card,
so Neocities failed to withdraw the monthly Supporter fee. I didn't
know what to do, so I canceled my subscription and bought it again. I
hope I won't be charged twice for that. After the meal, we finally
went for a walk. We went to the direction of the local river port,
climbed up the mounting with a nice view of the city, and climbed back
down to the river. There we saw a live perfomance of some local pop
band. The music itself wasn't too cringy, but the dancing of
middle-aged women, namely my mom and one of the guests, was. The music
itself reminded me of my dream to learn to play a music instrument. My
mom told me that it'd totally feasible, and finding the instrument
itself and a teacher is not that hard. After that, we went to some
square located a thousand miles away, where there alledgedly were
going to be fireworks. We decided not to wait for them because
otherwise we wouldn't be able to find any public transportation to get
home. Well, that's about it for the trip. Did I enjoy it? Yeah. Though
I wish I at least didn't eat thay shawarma because my stomach would
thank me.

## 2021-06-13

The celebration continues. But what are we even celebrating? In any
case, I woke up late today too, but this time the others weren't
having fun without me. After waking up, I made several updates to my
website as usual, and we were ready to head out at about 4 PM. First,
we went to the pool, where we also got a 50% discount because we
arrived after 5 PM. We were swimming for about 2 or 3 hours and then
went to KFC. There we once again ate a shitton of food. There's not
much else I can say about it for today because it was indeed not as
fun as yesterday.

## 2021-06-14

The celebration ended, and so did the fun. Basically, I did exactly
the same things as yesterday minus anything that involved others and
was actually enjoyable. It certainly feels like last summer when I had
absolutely nothing to do and suffered because of it but maybe to a
lesser degree. In addition to last summer, however, I'm even fatter
and lazier now, and I can't get it off my mind.

## 2021-06-15

Today was the first day of the "educational practice" as they call it
here in Russia. Basically, it's like internship, which we're also
gonna have afterwards, but the "employer" is the college. The topic of
this practice is databases, and we now are supposed to attend 2
classes everyday. Thankfully, I didn't have to attend anything because
of my clinic visit. Well, technically I could've attended if I decided
to go home by bus and not on foot, but fuck 'em. And even if I
insisted on attending, it seems like the teacher wasn't doing shit as
usual and let everyone leave, so there wouldn't be much sense in doing
that. The clinic visit wasn't too interesting - the only doctor I
visited was the psychologist, which told me to try to record what
emotions I'm having, and the only interesting thing was that they
finally stopped giving me antidepressants. As I already mentioned, I
went back home on foot using it as my usual justification of eating
too much. On my way home, I was researching the Wayland to see if it's
possible for me to make a toy display server using an ad-hoc protocol.
So far I concluded that it'd be impossible for me to make something as
complex as Wayland without shooting my foot so many times that I give
up, but I still keep researching stuff for some reason. I know that I
realistically won't be able to pull something like this off, yet my
brain doesn't want to give up. Well, I guess I'll just have to try.

## 2021-06-16

The day fucking sucked. We we only supposed to have one very late
class today, but my friends decided not to attend it, so I decided to
stay at home too. I was also told that the teacher doesn't give a shit
about whether we actually attend, so I guess I have a little bit of
justification for my actions. But even though I didn't go anywhere, it
didn't help much in terms of my mood. The day was extremely boring,
and considering how last summer went, I can only expect it to get
worse. In addition to that, I had a headache the whole day, which I
got yesterday and which didn't let me fall asleep for quite some time.
I got it by hanging upside down for too long using the new device my
dad recently bought. Basically you strap your legs on it, and then it
lets get you to flip yourself upside down. Hard to explain, but I
think you get the idea. Supposedly it helps with blood pressure and
back problems, but I misused it by hanging for too long and thus got a
headache. Perfect. And as a cherry on top of this cake, we haven't had
hot water for over a day, and I just happened to not have taken a
shower for like 5 days. The hot water was supposed to come back
yesterday evening, but it fucking didn't, so I guess the only choice I
have now is to shower with ice cold water. God, please fucking kill
me.
