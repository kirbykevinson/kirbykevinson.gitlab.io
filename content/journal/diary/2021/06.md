The first day of the summer, huh? My groupmates shared a schedule for
this month with me today, and as far as I understand, we'll have exams
and thesis presentation really really soon, and then there's gonna be
another practice. As I mentioned previously, I ran out of college
non-related things to do (or so I thought because I still have a
couple of extremely minor things to do), and I've been unsuccessfully
trying to start doing anything today. My friend is trying to help me
as much as possible, which I'm thankful for, but I still can't just
lift my ass. Our curator (honestly, I have no idea how it's called in
English, so let's pretend it's an appropriately applicable term)
called me today and was like "hey are you doing anything?" It was
extremely uncomfortable as usual, and we also scheduled a WhatsApp
call with her, my mom, and I, which is gonna happen so, but it's
probably gonna be as shitty as usual, so I likely won't even bother to
write about. The most realistic thing I can do right now is probably
databases, so I guess I know what to begin with.

So regarding my personal stuff, I did do a little bit minor. I cleaned
up the GitLab pipelines for my website, which cleaned over 500 MB of
space. I also cleaned up enabled features for my repos and removed a
project which didn't deserve a repo.

I've been recently questioning my religiousness. I say on my about
section that I'm an atheist, but am I really? I mean I do sort of
believe that the universe was created but don't believe in one
specific god. Does this count? Also I've had solipsistic thoughts too.
The main problem is just I can't grasp the concept of consciousness.
Why does this body have to be a vessel for my thoughts? My perception
of reality heavily depends on how this body functions biologically, so
why can't it just function on itself without involving *me*? I just
can't understand why I have to be a protagonist of some story. For
this reason, I have quite some doubts about whether other people
actually exist and whether they're like me. In any case, thinking
about it makes no sense because solipsism is unfalsifiable and whether
anything exists makes no practical difference, so I don't know why I
even waste my time on it.

Some progress has been made - I've successfully passed life safety.
All I had to do was one little work and a couple of test, on which the
teacher barely even looked. One task less, I guess. Other than that, I
spent the day trying to find college non-related stuff to do, doing
nothing, and learning the Wayland protocol for educational purposes.
Currently I have an idea to write a toy graphics toolkit/layout engine
and maybe make a video game based on it. Considering I'm using C, that
would be a quite challeging task to accomplish. By the way, I forgot
to mention, but my parents and I were kinda thinking about buying me
an apartment, which would solve the moving out problem, and it seems
like the things are going in the right direction - my dad says his
loan was approved, and they already reserved the apartment. Now we
only have to wait until it's built and renovated somehow.

The progress has stopped. I couldn't do anything today. Additionally,
I felt like shit. I suspect this can be because of the weather. The
exams start really soon (and I even thought we had one today), and I
think this time I could be not as lucky and get my ass slapped just as
I deserve. For my personal projects, I barely did anything - I finally
made a simple web page our programming teacher told me to do (as far
as I remember at least) and made a few adjustments for jamtext. I
think the latter can be released soon.

Okay, so today I had the second clinic visit of this week. Not much
happened except they lowered my antidepressant for some reason and the
fact that the therapist is going on a vacation, so they'll probably
replace her with another person. I went back home on foot once again
by a route I took the first time I did such a thing, and it felt much
easier than that time. Tomorrow we have a databases exam, and guess
what, my preparation is not going well. There are, like, 50 questions
to prepare for, and less than a half of them are related to SQL
(programming). So far I had one round of googling the answers, and I
wouldn't say it helped much. I feel kinda hopeless, but it's still
important that I mustn't let my laziness win, so I guess I'll keep
trying to start another round.

Well, the exam didn't go quite as well as I expected. I spent my way
to college anxiously preparing to the worst question torture possible,
but the exactly opposite happened. There were only 2 questions, and
there were quite easy, but I still managed to fuck up. As I have or
haven't mentioned, I haven't been doing the large task we were
assigned some time ago, and she decided that what I did wasn't enough
to even deserve a C, I should do the task and present it to her. I've
got time only until Monday, and these two days are not quite enough
for me. I have other exams to prepare for, and we also have a thesis
presentation soon, to which I'm currently absolutely unprepared, but I
guess I have no choice. Currently I sort of did the task itself, and
now I need to test if it actually works in production and write a
report, the latter of which I'm planning to do by stealing from my
friend. As you might know, I work poorly even under minimal pressure,
so you probably know how I feel right now.
