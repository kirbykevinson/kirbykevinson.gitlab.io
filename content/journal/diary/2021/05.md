## 2021-05-01

Today was a nice sunny day. I mean, teachnically there were clouds in
the sky, and it was even raining at some point, but you get the point.
My mom, my sister, and I had a walk planned for today. When we finally
got outside, my mom decided that it'd be nice if she just left us
alone. Well, weird flex but okay, I guess. The first thing we did was
going to KFC and spending a mindblowing amount of money of food. We
didn't buy much in terms of calories, and used coupons, but we still
managed to spend like 10 bucks. Next, we were going to go to the
cinema, but the choice of films wasn't too interesting, so we decided
to actually walk instead. We went in a random direction using buying
more stickers for my laptop as motivation. We visited a clothing shop,
a household product shop, and finally a book shop themed mall.
Initially we went to the last one to find manga, but there were none.
We checked all 4 floors - nothing. Then we realized that there was
another basement floor, where there was a music instrument shop and a
cosmetics shop. The first one didn't have anything interesting other
than ridiculously priced bass guitars, but the latter one actually
did. For god knows what reason, a fucking cosmetics shop actually had
some stickers. We bought several of them since they were actually
interesting. After that, we continued going down that street, and it
was actually kinda interesting since I'd never walked there before.
There was a great variety of shops and shit, but none of them could've
possibly had any stickers, of course. After some time, we reached the
river port, which is like basically on the boundary of our city
despite being in a central area. At that moment, I was really
interested in continuing walking since it was a pefect occasion for
that, but my sister suddenly decided that she got tired. I tried my
best to persuade her to continue walking, but I reached the limit when
she started moaning every 5 seconds and making random stops. Initially
I decided that I'd let her go home and walk all the way home on foot,
but I quickly realized that it'd be ridiculous, especially considering
I had no cash in case I'd want to take a marshrutka back home. So I
decided to go home with home with her, but first we had to make a
pause at a grocery store to buy some ice cream. We ended up buying
chocolate, water, and, you guessed it, stickers instead. Yes, there
was a office product store in the same building as the grocery store
and they happened to have stickers. When we got to the bus stop, we
instantly missed some stops since my sister had barely any idea what
bus we should be looking for, making us miss several good ones. We
ended up getting on a bus that goes in our direction but not quite -
we'd still have to walk 1 stop, but it's not so bad right? I can't
possibly imagine what was going on in my sister's had at the moment,
but she decided that we shouldn't go out at the intended stop and
instead should go one stop further. And again, she was fucking tired,
so I have no idea what motivated her so much. I decided to take the
best advantage of the situation and go to the shop nearby and buy some
stuff our mom told us, but she refused, so we had to split. I ended up
getting back home earlier than her, so I suspect she might be hiding
something from me. In any case, who cares.

Yesterday my mom promised that she'd go on a walk with me without my
sister. She lied. My sister and I had to go alone just like yesterday
while my mom was partying with guests at home because today's Easter
or something. We went to KFC as usual, where we ordered stuff similar
to yesterday's. I think we spent like 2 bucks less but still too
fucking much. Then we were supposed to take another nice long walk,
but she was like "nah, I'm going back home." Well, cool. So I decided
to go somewhere alone. I went in a random direction and started doing
turns in unknown directions to avoid visiting places I already knew. I
didn't do a good job at it because I soon got to a longass street,
which I saw countless times but was indeed walking down it on foot for
the first time. After the street ended, I reached another longass
street, which was filled with abandoned buildings and probably
homeless people and rapists. The weather was nice, and there were no
cars, so the atmosphere was calming, and I didn't worry much. I
perfectly knew how to get home from there, so I did it. It only took
about 20000 steps and destroying my feet. I'm satisfied.

My mom promised that she'd finally go on a walk with me today. She
didn't lie this time. Well, sort of. She woke me up at like 9 AM and
told me that she'd go without me if I don't wake up. As you can
expect, I'd have an incredibly boring day without a walk, so I just
had to agree. We had a choice between 2 shopping malls - one we've
been to countless times and one I didn't even know existed; I chose
the latter. It was located in a recently build disricts with lots of
houses built in the 2010s. It looked pretty creepy and deserted
because houses were standing far apart from each other and there were
nothing there other than apartment buildings and a giant mall. You
know, I don't like this kind of architecture, and I think modern
districts in, for example, Moscow or Hong Kong look much better than
what we have here. I mean, for fuck's sake, even khrushchevka
districts here (including the one I live in) look better, so I don't
know how it could even be designed. Did they purposefully wanted to
make people depressed with these abominations? Couldn't they at least
plant some trees or do something else so the whole thing doesn't look
like a scene from a dystopian movie? *Sigh*. In any case, the mall was
not quite as good as I expected. Like 80% of the mall was occupied by
an Auchan, and there was even no KFC there. What's the point of
calling it a mall if there's only one store in it? So we bought some
vacuum bags and food there. Then, because there was no KFC in it, we
went to another nearby mall, which was this time 99% occupied by Lenta
but did have a KFC, and ate some food there. We planned to go home on
foot afterwards, but my mom told me that her legs didn't feel too
great, and I was pretty lazy to defend my point of view, so we agreed
to take a tram home. At home we made a giant shawarma, which I
singlehandedly ate. No wonder I'm so fucking fat. I spent the rest of
the day doing GNOME debugging - mostly trying to figure out why the
shell starts so slowly. It turned out that I had `GTK_USE_PORTAL=1`
set for some unknown reason, and it was messing with GNOME services.
But to find this out, oh boy, I had to do quite some work launching
the shell a hundred of times under a different user with only some
configs copied from mine. Maybe I should make a bug report? Probably
not since it's I who fucked up, but I don't know.

The day was much more boring than yesterday. I spent most of the day
inside staring at the monitor. But to be fair, I did get outside
once... to go to KFC. I did walk back home on foot, so I guess I'm
satisfied that I walked at least the daily dose of steps. The weather
outside is so nice, I wish I had a reason to get out more frequently.
Inside, I spent most of the time torturing myself with GNOME Wayland
bugs. Tomorrow I'm finally going to my new therapist, and I hope
everything will go fine.

So the therapist visit turned out to be a bit more exciting than I
expected. As I've mentioned (or have I), the clinic is located is
outside of the city. Well, technically it is inside but in a remote
district I'd never visited before. The clinic itself is quite large
and looks like an actual hospital rather than a soviet shack. In
contrast with the previous clinic where there are barely any
specialists, here I was promised a whole complex of psychologists,
psychiatrists, therapists and other workers. We went there at like 9
AM with the referral we were given yesterday. First, we went to the
main doctor, who began torturing me with questions just like I
expected. I told her about my 3 main worries - suicidal thoughts, lack
of motivation, and unreasonable anxiety. She seems like a highly
skilled and professional woman who I can handle my shit. Though it
looks like she's a truscum, but that's pretty much to be expected
because, come on, we live in a fucking third world country. Also I'm
not here to solve my gender issues, so I guess whatever. So she also
started evaluating whether she actually wants to serve me and whether
I agree. Additionally, I asked her about how the whole thing works and
what doctors do what. Then we went to some other person who was also
meeting every person who contacts their clinic. She asked me more
specific questions, wrote a dossier on me, and gave me some papers to
sign. Then we went back to the previous person, and she asked more
questions and explained more of my questions. While we were at it, I
showed her my website. Then she directed to my actual therapist who's
gonna handle my shit daily. She asked me even more even more personal
questions and wrote my answers in an even more detailed digital
dossier. She told me when to attend and what methods of torture
they're gonna use on me. Finally, we went to the lady that gave me
free drugs, this time slightly different from mine with less
side-effects. She also gave me the doctor schedule and when I should
go to the blood/urine test. And that was about it for the day. The
whole thing took like 5 hours because of excruciatingly long lines,
but it wasn't too bad. So will it be alright here? I don't know, we'll
see.

Some more things I forgot to mention. First, it turns out I gained 8
kilos. This is fucked up but expected considering how many KFC visits
per day I make. Second, my doctor said that with my shit it's unlikely
that I can get hormones. Well, too bad. I can do DIY instead, so who
cares. Third, my mom and I just went back there, this time using
public transportation. It seems like it's not too far, and it's pretty
easy to get there.
