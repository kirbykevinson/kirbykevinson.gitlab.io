## 2021-07-01

Not a single thing changed. Today was just as mindlessly boring as it
was a year ago. I couldn't find any activity that would cheer me up. I
tried watching a movie, but it still somehow didn't help. Maybe I
didn't choose a movie good enough. In any case, I have over 2 months
more to suffer, so I'll probably eventually find one. In addition to
boredom, only 2 days are left until we present the shit, and they even
planned to reschedule it to tomorrow but hopefully changed their
minds. For others, it's not a big deal because all they have to do is
change a couple of lines in their old report while my report is an
indescribable piece of shit that requires a lot of labor to make
suitable for anything. I'm not sure what I'm going to do in this case.
My friend proposed me to just join him and present a single work, but
I don't know, that sounds quite ridiculous. The only choice I see
right now that I can manage is to give up.
