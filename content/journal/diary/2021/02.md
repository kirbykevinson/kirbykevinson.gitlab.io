## 2021-02-01

I was completely unprepared for the classes and expected the whole
thing to be a disaster, but it luckily wasn't one. Thank God.

I've been recently thinking about coming out to my class. I know that
doing things regarding my gender identity is technically taking care
of myself, but I still feel like I'd feel bad for doing it because
there are more important issues in my life that also need to be taken
care of. In any case, I'll try. By the way, it's been more than a
month since I last tried to contact my doctor. She's most likely back,
so I'll try to schedule an appointment tomorrow, and hopefully
everything will go fine.

In any case, I need to come out on this website first. [Here's the
blogpost].
