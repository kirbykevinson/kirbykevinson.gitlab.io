it

## 2020-10-11

the game called doom 2003

it had good graphics and in contrast to the original game utilized a
lot or cutscenes

also it was set in a bunker or something

the main character of the game had problems with parents

in one of the cutscenes when perfectly executed he empties a container
onto himself and some girl and paints his and her hair

[fell asleep and woke up again]

it's about a teenager who had problems in his past

he was moving from his house in canada by an underground train

the train got attacked by a monster but got saved by a superhero or
shit

then it was revealed that the guy is gonna work for the train company

they show him his workplace and he starts crying when he sees his name
on the screen

## 2020-10-21

i work for an american radio and we go to some southern town to have
fun

there were also 2 dreams before that but i don't remember them

except one scene where my ass was covered in shit

## 2020-10-22

me at some waterpark or shit

or more like a playground idk

being there involved using an app that was really similar to discord
but was targeting families instead of gamers

it also had a built-in search engine and a web browser i guess

some really weird shit happened there

in the next dream i was on a vacation

it was near a body of water where a competition took place?

not really sure because i forgot a lot

i used some cool apps on my laptop to track something

also our english teacher was there and in the end i was given some
task that i had to do in excel

[regarding the weird shit in the first dream] despite being targeted
to families a lot of servers i visited were made of edgy gamers

also in one of the servers there was some old os with accounting
software or something made into a web page

on one of the servers there was minecraft playing in the background

and somehow at some point i managed to summon a naked transgender
version of ariana grande

finally a nice long dream

## 2020-10-23

the cowboy throw

in order to execute it you have to get behind the person and launch
him in the air at the 45 degree angle

i think i was launched once and was running at an extremely fast speed
afterwards

also there was something related to spongebob

## 2020-10-24

i remember a couple of scenes

a scene where i'm riding a car instead of marshrutka in the early
morning with no light

a scene where a girl talks about her broken robot and how good it was

a scene with tom scott swimming in the pool while fat guys are trying
to ride an inflatable pillow

the scenes were alledgedly connected by a post-apocalyptic plot
