the game called doom 2003

it had good graphics and in contrast to the original game utilized a
lot or cutscenes

also it was set in a bunker or something

the main character of the game had problems with parents

in one of the cutscenes when perfectly executed he empties a container
onto himself and some girl and paints his and her hair

[fell asleep and woke up again]

it's about a teenager who had problems in his past

he was moving from his house in canada by an underground train

the train got attacked by a monster but got saved by a superhero or
shit

then it was revealed that the guy is gonna work for the train company

they show him his workplace and he starts crying when he sees his name
on the screen
