trying to install my old point and click games but failing

just like in real life

1. something about 2 shops one of which is branded and one is regular

the branded one was illegal or something and i shouldn't've been
visiting it or whatever

2. i download a video game demo from the internet and it turns out to
   be very emotional and one of the best things i've ever played

it takes me some time to find out where exactly i downloaded it from
but it turns out to be a rando from neocities

3. watching a kirby let's play in the kitchen while my clothes are
   being washed in the microwave

my mom proposes an idea that they're all not real and are just a
product of my imagination and it really fucks with my brain

alexei shevtsov talking about the game the call of duty for
playstation six

it had large open world and realistic graphics but could barely run at
60 fps in full hd

before that there was a dream where i was in thailand

i swam too much and had to be taken to a doctor

also we discovered some nes game while visiting an abandoned building
