1. something about 2 shops one of which is branded and one is regular

the branded one was illegal or something and i shouldn't've been
visiting it or whatever

2. i download a video game demo from the internet and it turns out to
   be very emotional and one of the best things i've ever played

it takes me some time to find out where exactly i downloaded it from
but it turns out to be a rando from neocities

3. watching a kirby let's play in the kitchen while my clothes are
   being washed in the microwave

my mom proposes an idea that they're all not real and are just a
product of my imagination and it really fucks with my brain

chapter i think

i downloaded the leaked files and started browsing through them

there was a mobile game or something and a couple of cutscenes were

hosting
