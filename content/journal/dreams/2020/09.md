2 giant multistory restaurants in the forest

one was expensive as fuck with elite food and one was affordable

i was walking around and waiting until the food was cooked

some groupmates were there too

both buildings were built out of wood and had no roofs

prolly there were even built around trees

[fell asleep and woke up again]

japanese underground town

i watched a documentary and was also going to drive there with my dad
but something went wrong

the documentary described some conflict there

in the end one guy beat up several other guys and everything became
fine

i think i was watching it when we were driving

i'm not sure if it was day or night

also i'm not sure if i was sitting or lying because the seats in the
car was reclined all the way down or something

the first day at a new school

everything went fine until i decided to take a shit

for some reason people were very unhappy by my decision and publicly
shamed me

the director herself went to the restroom and opened the door to shame
me

lots of people were watching

also there was no toilet but just a hole in the ground

i think they took my toilet paper and i was begging to give me some

after this dream there was another one with also the first at a new
school

there i could finally take a shit properly

the subjects were weird

can't remember particularly but it was sci-fi whit

the school was also giant and divided into blocks or something and
there were sci-fi bikes to ride
