prolly there were even built around trees

[fell asleep and woke up again]

japanese underground town

i watched a documentary and was also going to drive there with my dad
but something went wrong

the documentary described some conflict there

in the end one guy beat up several other guys and everything became
fine

i think i was watching it when we were driving

i'm not sure if it was day or night

also i'm not sure if i was sitting or lying because the seats in the
car was reclined all the way down or something

the first day at a new school

everything went fine until i decided to take a shit

for some reason people were very unhappy by my decision and publicly
shamed me

the director herself went to the restroom and opened the door to shame
me

lots of people were watching

also there was no toilet but just a hole in the ground

i think they took my toilet paper and i was begging to give me some

after this dream there was another one with also the first at a new
school

there i could finally take a shit properly

the subjects were weird

can't remember particularly but it was sci-fi whit

the school was also giant and divided into blocks or something and
there were sci-fi bikes to ride

[fell asleep and woke up again]

weird shit

first there was a weird building which i quit

i think it was owned by google translate and it was facing other
buildings improperly

then i started walking uphill

i entered a cafe where i went to the toilet

i got my dick sucked by multiple people and after that the cafe turned
into a giant room and people sucking my dick turned into a giant slime

i'm not sure what happened next but i woke up in the end

regular one and a thinkpad

## 2020-09-25

playing a video game

it had 3d graphics and i'm not sure whether it was 1st person or 3rd
person

i think it was a platformer but it also had crafting and rpg elements?

on some point i found some pigs that drop very rare material which
allows you to craft "legendary" items

i first crafted a knife then a large pickaxe and then bullets

i used the last ones in space but idk how i got there

i think they produced a large explosion

too much shit most of which i forgot

there was a movie (starring jackie chan) and it had a sequel with
anime characters

also there was a star wars movie where the good guys were losing and
honestly it was better than the actual 9th episode

i played minecraft with several people we were building a giant
underground base or something

it had problems with lighting but i used a non-existent chandelier
block and it became fine

in the end there was a weird ubuntu installation process

it was like in vr and mickey mouse was offering shit to play with
before installing idk
