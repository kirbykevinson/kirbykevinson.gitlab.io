sci-fi bullshit with robots being sent from the future

but with a casual atmosphere and on a small island

i was one of the robots

btw it wasn't a humanoid robot but more like a smart drone

[fell asleep and woke up again]

virtual world in paintings

at first i was traveling between them but in the end i was sitting in
the bathtub playing with action figures

there was at least 1 minecraft world and 1 medieval simpsons world

i sleepn't
