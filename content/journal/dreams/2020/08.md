operating system installation with challenges

some parts of the installer couldn't be accessed until a certain
moment and the system partition was getting mirrored after each reboot
which it did regularly

the installer had windows 95 like ui

also the whole thing happened while flying through some surreal space
filled with clouds

[fell asleep and woke up again]

1. welcoming astronauts from a multi-year space mussion

i think an entire house was built for that

2. giant disney themed trampoline park

with no people

idk what i was doing there

but it was also built to welcome someone

[fell asleep and woke up again]
