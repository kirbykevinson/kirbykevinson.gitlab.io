playing video games

one had a very surreal setting and had very weird and unrecognizable
things in it

it was also supposedly inspired by undertale but idk

another one had some undertale characters but otherwise was a
completely different game

there was a scene with driving in the desert and a scene where sans
was fed chocolate and somehow it damaged him

there was also other games but i forgot them

i don't understand it

just me and the boys doing random shit

i think we all made a website on our own

before that i think maybe several dreams before that there was another
dream

it was about virtual worlds that are somehow created by the person's
mind and they were having adventures there

like trying to find a perfect one but failing idk

the worlds were small like room sized

also i think it was a tv series

the atmosphere there was pretty bittersweet and i really like it
