playing video games

one had a very surreal setting and had very weird and unrecognizable
things in it

it was also supposedly inspired by undertale but idk

another one had some undertale characters but otherwise was a
completely different game

there was a scene with driving in the desert and a scene where sans
was fed chocolate and somehow it damaged him

there was also other games but i forgot them

just me and the boys doing random shit

i think we all made a website on our own

before that i think maybe several dreams before that there was another
dream

it was about virtual worlds that are somehow created by the person's
mind and they were having adventures there

like trying to find a perfect one but failing idk

the worlds were small like room sized

also i think it was a tv series

the atmosphere there was pretty bittersweet and i really like it

indescribable mess

in one dream there were 2 video games from the same series

i don't remember the first one but the second one was basically
outlast but not scary and 2d

they were kinda famous and had an interesting development history or
shit

in another dream there was a tv series with some paranormal shit
happening

it was set in a school and the main characters were 2 shy girls and 1
guy

one shy girl was involved in paranormal shit and the others weren't

in the last dream i remember there was a very steep road

apparently it was in japan and the main character were going biking
there
