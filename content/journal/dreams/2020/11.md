playing video games

one had a very surreal setting and had very weird and unrecognizable
things in it

it was also supposedly inspired by undertale but idk

another one had some undertale characters but otherwise was a
completely different game

there was a scene with driving in the desert and a scene where sans
was fed chocolate and somehow it damaged him

there was also other games but i forgot them
