## 2020-01-02

almost forgot it

(not almost but completely)

a

there was something related to minecraft

which makes sense considering i was planning to play it today

## 2020-01-03

parallel universe and time travel shit but it's a tv series for
teenagers

also tony "the stuff" stark was there

also i just rememered a couple of scenes where i'm on a marshrutka

idk how it matches the rest but okay

## 2020-01-04

preparing to write a website in some classroom

there were like 10 people

at least 4 of them were called boris

the season outside was fall and the weather was kinda fucked up
(cloudy + extreme winds)

that's it

## 2020-01-05

some [place where I'm studying in] related stuff

but not studying

alsp no actual [place where I'm studying in] people

couldn't remember anything in greater detail

## 2020-01-06

(i probably had several ones but i only remember the last one)

so i walk down the street and i'm hungry

the first shop is nice and has low prices but is fake

the second one doesn't sell anything interesting

the third one turns out to be remotely okay

in the end i order fries hamburger onion sandwich(?) and some other
shit

so after i ate i stand up and see a hole in the wall filled with dirt

so i dig it up and go into a minecraft-like cave

and i find some secret documents about an [random city name] elevator
company

(that look like a wikipedia article)

also they appear to use some rare programming languages

one is literally called }}}}

and not sure about the other one

probably was some russian slang word

## 2020-01-07

it's complicated

1. dream in a dream

layer 1 - i don't remember anything except that in the end i suddenly
get my dick sucked by a like 50 year-old guy without my consent

layer 2 - i don't remember but i swear i did when i actually woke up
for a moment afterwards

2. railroads

again

first i wait some really long time to get on a subway(?) train

there's a fuckton of people but not so much they wouldn't fit and the
shit appears to be operational so idk why we need to wait

so i go to some pool or something and talk to random people and then
get on the train and travel to some city(?)

then for some reason i go to a café with floor flooded with water on
purpose (like 20-30 cm) and apparently prepare to eat with my sister

3(?) random big guys go to me and switch 3 apples from me to a deck of
cards while i'm not paying attention

then i somehow switch them back without touching them and they get
surprized

that's it

what the actual fuck

## 2020-01-08

don't remember most of it but in the end i use a non-existent search
engine to find an image of an old mosaic of the town of [name similar
to one of my friend's name]

it was in english

and looked kinda like google

but more shitty

## 2020-01-10

so first i take a ride on a train to some small russian town

it apparently has high crime rate and is filled with old soviet
garbage

and i'm going there for some entertainment shit

related to gravity or something

the whole thing happens in some (probably 1 story high) mall which
exterior is build out of bricks

when the perfomance ends (there were a lot of kids btw) it's suddenly
night and the mall closes

i just happen to forget some of my clothing and some other guy did too

so somehow without cracking the door we get in (several times) take
back our shit and i go back by a train

i'm back to sleep

or am i djdieoakamsndndbdjdnd

## 2020-01-11

random shit

there was something related to zoo and bicycles

yes

## 2020-01-13

watching earrape videos on youtube

also something related to spaceships

## 2020-01-17

fucked up shit

there was a couple of car riding scenes

## 2020-01-22

me and the rest of the group playing hide 'n' seek on the second floor
of some weird building

([friend's name] appeared once too but i didn't interact with him)

it was also prolly happening in the summer

what the fuck

i'm back to shleep

okay wait

i remembered another scene

that happened before that

i launch kirby's dream land (for game boy) in an emulator(?)

and it's in fucking color

so i for some reason go to that building to tell y'all

what the fuck (x2)

## 2020-01-25

1. something something generic space anime/movie whatever the hell
2. i take an interview with the director of some british porn studio

turns out they have to ask the government each time they want to
capture something

and also they shoot most of their shit in some russian building

the interview itself happened in some palace/museum(?) where i
suspected for some reason they shot their works

idk what happened directly afterwards but a giant green fucking
octopus attacks their headquarters blows up some electronics and
starts saying something

what the fuck was that

## 2020-01-26

1. [place where I'm studying in] shit
2. [place where I'm studying in] shit but i'm skipping classes to go
   to the forest to find random people who try to kill me
3. [place where I'm studying in] shit but not actually [place where
   I'm studying in] shit because i graduated(?)

the dreams were randomly interrupted by barely related nonsensical
minecraft gameplay

no actual [place where I'm studying in] locations appeared

the only actual student was [my friend] in form of a voice(?)

overall not the most fucked up dreams

## 2020-01-31

1 and also 3. i'm in some ocean with only a life saving vest or
mattress or something and a phone(?)

the ocean is warm and not deep btw

i google some things and they magically appear near me

   do with them

   conference or something while i'm hanging out at the roof
2. i'm at my grandma's old house and i'm browsing geocities (which are
   dead and i've never actually browsed) and listening to some shit

[point 1] i could also see planes landing while being on the roof

## 2020-02-02

idk

some weird youtube shit perhaps related to günbúrstér?


that's all i remembered

## 2020-02-04

barely remember anything

there was a scene where i was walking through some underground arena
with a guy from men in black [agent k] and he was just talking while
turning on the lamps

also a scene where i somehow broke an old clock

## 2020-02-07

i'm in some mall

a small mall

also there are no people

there was an art exhibition with pretty much regular paintings

and some museum of abstract art or shit

also very small

there was a scene i browsed something on my phone while sitting on the
first floor i guess

i found some disgusting chinese hentai and a youtube video where a
person replaced his cock with pipes or something

(cyborg shit)

also apparently i got home after that mall and weird shit was also
happening while i was walking but i don't remember much

at home i wrote to someone in \[messenger\](?) and also suggested my
mom watching something

## 2020-02-08

watching a twitch(?) stream for some reason

the streamer is some ~25yo white guy

he wrote an airplane physics simulation(?) in minecraft and shows it

also the guy has two alter egos or something

that was weird

## 2020-02-09

someone tries to kill me at [place where I'm studying in]

using magic

there are some people with green(?) skin and i need to find them to
progress

the scene starts at the 3rd floor

then when i found enough of them some black flying cube attacks me

\[friend\](?) was sent to my resque but he can't do shit

we run to the 4th floor and i don't remember what happened later

then i fake woke up (went to layer 2)

for some reason the location is my old grandma's house

at night

wrong place) and wake up

hdbsnwlanabsbwhq

## 2020-02-11

2 in-game dialogs

don't remember what game and what dialogs

## 2020-02-12

making the website but it's even more fucked up than in reality

there was a website called zelda.com

they apparently have irl stores and also sell furnitute

uhhh

¿that's it?

no

there was a scene where i go into their bank and get refused

probably did some joke shit

and also where i walk inside and outside their mall or whatever that
is

## 2020-02-13

watching some speeches on youtube

about mac os for some reason

## 2020-02-15

1. i'm doing random shit in moscow with people i don't know

after arriving i have a flashback after seeing a building that doesn't
exist irl

there was a scene where 2 guys who look similar to each other try to
rob one another after applying make up and hairstyle but one meets
another

2. i'm going to a psychologist?

looks more like a murderer for some reason

and the building where it happened is fucking enormous with a garden
and a small river inside

idk what happened after

3. some company overthrows the russian government

don't remember company of what field

but they were building a megafactory or something

i'm their agent and i go to some musician's (singer's?) house and try
to convince his mother about something

i nearly kill her in the end by throwing some long metallic shit at
her but the musician agrees about something and i leave and wake up

## 2020-02-16

celebration of world war 3

for some reason i thought i needed to bring my grandma some baloons so
i decided to do so

idk most of the path but there was a large frontyard mostly filled
with snow and some russian school in the distance

also i met [friend] here for some reason

when i got there (my apartment? but if it is where did i come from)
another person was with me turned out i didn't need to do that but it
turned out to be okay and i and my sister tasted some weird chocolate
shit

what the fuck

## 2020-02-17

"How Google, the KDE Project, and the US government stole the Google
domain"

(youtube video)

pretty interesting btw

also there was google's website called crash.com which hosted a font
and had their old 2000s design

which they apparently created with the partnership of 7zip

wait

there was also a video where a japanese actor came into his hotel room
after the hotel had been destroyed

and he just stayed there for some reason

## 2020-02-19

preparing to watch a movie about jojo(?)

with the group (no [friend] this time)

the cinema looked like a soviet factory with blank walls carpeted
floor and a couch for some reason

the room either changed the color or i was there 2 times

i didn't see the movie itself btw

also [another friend] was there and complained that the movie was too
gay

## 2020-02-23

a lot of them [dreams]

very massive and most of them forgotten

the main one:

there's a bunch of hyperintelligent animals from the african savannah

they somehow found a way to talk to/control a chosen human

and there's a human group (agency) which tries to kill them

again i forgot almost eveything by now but i remember that there were
at least a giraffe and 2 dogs in the group and some of them were
killed

also they traveled a fuckton of locations including probably another
dimension

## 2020-02-24

1. some performance

probably super bowl (stretcher) or some shit

the stadium was massive and i didn't pay attention to the perfomance
itself

also it was summer and probably in a desert

2. someone asks me to check something and i get put into a prison

a shitty prison i should say because the room had giant glass walls
and i was able to repeatedly escape with no consequences

there was also a young guy and an asshole lady (from the personnel
perhaps) in the room

the prison was apparently located in a place similar to one near my
house but some buildings were missing

there probably were another dreams but i didn't remember

## 2020-02-25

very interesting train journey with my dad(?)

nice landscapes + summer

sometimes it for some reason was like in minecraft but maybe that's a
different dream idk

according to the dream the railroad was between [a town in one region]
and [another town in another region] and i was going to arrive at 5 am

## 2020-02-26

1. nothing particular but just a bittersweetish feeling
2. some story about how 2 neighbors cooperated to improve their
   apartments

also somehow related to my grandpa but the apartment was wrong

3. weird shit

one scene where i look in the mirror and i have a red beard and shave
it instantly

also one with some emulator app on my phone but i don't entirely get
why and how

the emulated os looked kinda like android but not idk

i think there was a scene where i talk to [friend] on the 4th floor
and mention how i'd talked to him in a dream which is ironic because
that's literally what happened

prolly there were others but i forgot them

## 2020-02-28

don't remember except that [one groupmate] and [another groupmate]
were there and we visited some broken website with an animation or
something

probably belonged to [the latter groupmate]

## 2020-02-29

russian or italian hotel

known people with me include [one groupmate] and [another groupmate]

the hotel itself looked kinda good (at least for most of the rooms)

there were problems such as no running water and not working toilets
in some places and one more that i forgot

[the latter groupmate] used some video game style shit to "spawn items
from the past" or something not sure what that means but there were
item ids(?) and wrong items appeared and also inside the trash can

the last item was kinda important or whatever and having it put me
into a trouble but as i said i forgot which exactly

## 2020-03-01

programming lesson but we're writing in c

(not actually writing but copypasting code)

in the result we made some paint or shit but i'm not sure if it worked

## 2020-03-02

website-related shit

1. some 2000s textual omegle-like website
2. the same but it turns out it was made by some guy as a joke
   (prank?) and i share it and it becomes popular(?)
3. also similar shit but i'm now somehow responsible for developing it
   and it has a separate christian(?) fan site or something

i think there was also minecraft but i'm not sure and one where i
partially retell some of those dreams to [the person I'm writing to]
irl and/or in [messenger]

## 2020-03-03

i believe there was black times new roman text on white background and
thinking about waking up

can't say much elsecan't say much else

## 2020-03-06

i walk through some building to meet a person but everyone's shooting
there are corpses everywhere and the person is running away

also i think it was a video game or a movie because i later saw the
website of this thing or something

also photos from the running guy(?) but idk

[fell asleep and woke up again]

vague shit

airport?

random non-sensical mobile app

and walking downstairs outside in complete darkness with my mom

that's all i remembered

## 2020-03-07

yes

1. weird crap

(probably video game because i could use free cam)

i don't remember much except they turned me into a giant a crow and a
diary several times (according to the dream because i don't remember
that)

also there was a depressiveish bedroom and me [groupmate] and random
guys were there

i was there 2 times and on the first time someone fell through 2
floors and broke them

i think jackie chan was there too

2. some small town

probably european and located on an island

moderately fucked up shit was happening there

i don't remember any of the characters except one very polite homeless
guy that could also hack vending machines for food

also there was a scene where a person was scared of another person and
he pulled a tree from the ground for some reason

a

forgot to mention i fake woke up several times and just thought even
more times about documenting the dream

## 2020-03-08

1. more website shit

can't say anything more specific

2. uh?

i'm in some protected government building

there is/was also another building in the direction i'm looking

so the guards look kinda fake and they just walk like the queen's
guards but whatever

they encounter hitler(!) and call other staff and they threaten him
(with an iron sword from minecraft) and he tells them some secrets

there was a camp in that building and something really fucked up
happened there or something

## 2020-03-09

1. basically super dimension fortress macross but crappier

also i think i saw a wikipedia map with ukraine and the entire
european russia highlighted in violet and landed on a planet in the
end

2. [the place I'm studying in] but everyone pretends it's museum in
   london

some locations look convincing but some look like they're from a
russian school

absolutely random people but but at least in english

on one of the floors if you turn right there was a door and if you
enter there were just people sitting on benches and doing some shit on
their pcs while whispering

also there was a location from one of my previous dreams

some concrete platform around the building that you climb

it was kinda weird because i was half naked while climbing

i think there was a water park or something

also there was a chimney filled with sawdust(?) and some old lady was
screaming at me while i was falling through it into a fireplace

## 2020-03-10

riding buses at night and shit

also some open source licensing article in the end

## 2020-03-11

visiting my relative and an old friend but their houses were random

also something about 4chan

some young (like 5yo) guys were imprisoned for some reason

[fell asleep and woke up again]

pretty much a regular spongebob episode but it's in cgi and
characters' faces look weird

[fell asleep and woke up again]

an ant man(?) movie

no one shrinked once so i'm not sure

also one of my teachers was there and it was weird

the main characters (ant man himself and some other guy) resisted the
villains but in the end they created the "ant queen" whatever the fuck
that means

it looked like an octopus with hunderds of thin tentacles and the main
character was inside it or something

both the other guy and the man villain were sad/disappointed by that
idk

## 2020-03-13

1. island again

also kind of european

i just suddenly spawned in the middle of it and was trying to escape

it happened 2 times i think

there were random people and my mom but i don't remember who was on
which time

i had to illegally break into people's houses and some port

also not sure if we even escaped

2. oh god

our directors calls me to the first floor

i go there he puts me on the floor grabs my collar and starts saying
this with a serious voice

"did you try to sneak a full fucking pizza again"

and as i remember i did order an actual pizza bended it and tried to
sneak it for some reason

## 2020-03-14

1. don't remember anything except some solid blue color
2. me editing the dream journal file and using ethmenu

the last one was really rapid and messy

## 2020-03-15

1. more free software licensing shit

also thoughts about obsession going insane and documenting this dream

2. homm3 but irl

also with minecraft elements

i played with another person i think

btw i remember the last battle

there was something related to tnt

so we fucked up

and decided to flip the axis of the world

but the wrong axis

and we drowned in lava

## 2020-03-16

vaguely remember

there was something about video game development and space industry

but those two were not connected

i think i viewed works of other people or interviewed them i'm not
sure

## 2020-03-17

1. [the place i'm studying in] but everyone and everything is random
   including the locations and the interior

except the math teacher

it was some holiday prolly my birthday

i was "trying on" different diseases for some reason

2. something about a photo of the eifel tower in the distance

i saw it cropped differently 2 times online i think

and it was related to some islamic country and another one

3. similar to 1 but it looks like shit

(a soviet school)

i remember a car near the shit (delorean perhaps)

also this phrase:

* normal cat mode
* cat having sex

a guy said this and then slapped the shit out of a news reporter which
was in the room (prolly basement)

also there was something related to a door lock that was actually
giant internally (in the same room)

and "you have time to eat before 12:30"

also a dozen of fake in-dream wake ups to document this shit

## 2020-03-18

some webring idk

## 2020-03-20

[the place I'm studying in] but severely more fucked up

more floors (8 + 4 underground)

some signs are translated to english

there's a regular elevator and a "lightweight vehicle lift"

the interiors look pretty familiar (soviet) but kinda not

i was graduating or something and weird shit was happening

not sure about the teachers but [a groupmate] probably was there

outside it was summer i think and i got into some trouble there

bees or something sticky

there was a floor(?) with fully glass walls and some guys moved the
walls of the room they weren't supposed to get in to inspect it

hard to describe and sounds weird but it also was so in the dream

the room was near the wall (not connected) and the walls of the room
itself were pretty slim and made out of metal/cardboard idk

all other stuff i remember is just staircases hallways and not working
drinking fountains

there were a lot of people but they were random

## 2020-03-21

several dreams but i barely remember two of them

or is it actually one i'm not sure

1. some gaming website

i was looking for a [probably point 'n' click] game i played as a
child i believe

also one of my old friends was there at some point

2. yes

i'm in a train with a random guy

and we talk

i think one of the topics of the discussion was cities and i mentioned
moscow and some american city

the railroad was itself located somewhere in "southern america" and
everything outside looked almost like a desert with orangeish sand

i'm not sure if that means us south or south america

both dreams were in english i think [and there also was something
about my diary and the collapse of the world's economic system]

## 2020-03-22

traveling by some form of transportation somewhere

probably with my mom

i just was doing shit on my phone

i discovered that callmecarson is/was actually a musician

i'm not sure if i heard the music itself but there was some random
speech from him before every song

also he posted some shit on stackoverflow in 2011 i think that became
a meme

something related to monochrome blue and green screens and how one is
actually another

not sure what the fuck that's supposed to mean

## 2020-03-23

something related to facebook

(trends and some unusual shit)

also one of [friends of the person I'm writing to] was there

## 2020-03-24

[the place I'm studying in] but random everything

there was some jazz band going to play but i and some other people
snuck in some room near the concert hall

idk why

also a tram going on a bridge

and it had a portion of rails not supported by anything

## 2020-03-25

an old friend of mine was there online

and i was in an elevator i think

also there was some homm3

## 2020-03-26

i was a character of a movie but i was aware of that

also i could scroll it/skip time

the movie was set in the 90s and had apparently something to do with
simpsons

[In the movie itself I watched a TV program about 2000s which had
"2000" and a starry background in their opening.]

i remember skipping time each day to the evening to talk to some
person on a mountain

also the dream interrupted in the middle or it was a whole different
dream

there i was eating [food] in the canteen as usual and some guys were
mocking me

also in the end the fans on my pc (which there are actually none irl)
went insane because my pc overheated and i had to turn it off

i asked my dad if it could be because it's always on and he said yes

but i questioned it since it'd always been okay

and it's actually okay irl

[fell asleep and woke up again]

1. my apartment

but with more cats

i petted them and they purred

cool

[Actually not so cool because one of them was bald and deflated after
I started petting him.]

2. some computer room

here everyone also pretended it's the 90s

the monitors looked obviously 2010s but when i asked they told me
because "it's russian [technology]"

also i think other people looked familiar and [one groupmate] and
[another groupmate] could be there

not sure about [the person I'm writing to]

btw the computers had windows xp installed but [the latter groupmate]
i think used some non-existent irl program to make it look like 3.11

a

i think [the first groupmate] also called someone a faggot

## 2020-03-27

very long shit barely remember anything

(not in any particular order)

something about my grandparents' dacha

something about minecraft

(some let's player that played the game for a long time idk)

something about vehicles

(there was a chasing scene in the mountains and a dialog between the
main character and another one in the cave where they repaired their
vehicle or something)

also maybe something about tv

## 2020-03-29

star wars scene

palpatine sitting in his ship

the light guys™ bring a bunch of star destroyers and an unknown
triangular ship

palpatine: "yes, yes. use your star destroyers. i can feel them"

the light guys: \*ram the triangular ship into his\*

palpatine: "ah fuck"

both ships crash and both the main cast characters and palpatine die

also i fake woke up after that and was typing this text to send [to
the person I'm writing to] using a toilet

also when i flushed there was film stock in the water

[fell asleep and woke up again]

1. minecraft wooden box house but irl (also with server side plugins
   that were also irl) and my batya bought it

also a pen that can cut through anything

and also some insane airport shit caused by my sister

2. something related to houses too

i believe it obama has some relation to that

## 2020-03-30

hmdmgdfjsrhshrssthtjdykf

something related to my piece of shit computer

also something happyish idk i don't remember

## 2020-03-31

i'm in hospital and making up an insane plot for a game

a visual novel i guess but it didn't look like one in my thoughts

i don't remember much detail except it contained something related to
wolfs and martial arts

different characters go through similar shit in different time periods
and the later the more fucked up the shit gets

also i think i saw the logo of "aim for the top 3" which obviously
doesn't exist yet

## 2020-04-01

1. unknown building (probably either a military comission one or a
   basement entrance) but it's located near the apartment block of my
   grandma's old house

the building was surrounded by snow and A LOT of literal dog shit

there were a couple of people i believe but they weren't outside

there also were alternative versions(?) of this building where the
surroundings looked normal idk how and the shit switched into
minecraft in the end and i switched my difficulty to the non-existent
irl one where mobs just do nothing

2. some class idk

maybe english maybe something else but i don't remember actually
studying + not sure where it happened but all walls were white and it
was evening

there was a scene where i hold a 40 inch(!) tablet pc and go to some
guy to ask about the chromium browser

i think it was some feature taken from the "vp11" video codec related
to skipped frame intrapolation or something idk why it'd be something
special

also i forgot the feature and had to go back to another guy (both were
pretty old this one had a purple shirt and that one a light blue one)
before actually asking

the one who i asked said it's bullshit i also asked if i can ask him
about firefox but he said something about time and i had to run back
to the classroom idk

i went to the water fountain first and had some troubles getting back

one of the troubles was the fact that i suddenly woke up

wait i think there was a dream before the first one where i installed
a trilogy of some point 'n' click games on my phone

i remember an underwater location as the first level in the first game

also i'm not entirely sure about the order of the scenes

## 2020-04-02

i'm on a vacation i guess

my family and some girl in one scene were with me also

not sure what country that was but there was a giant pool/lake and
everyone spoke english i think

considering i have thoughts about the time period i can assume i was
also time traveling

i only remember like 3 scenes

in the first one we somehow climbed a giant inflatable water slide

my mom tried to slide but she fell in the wrong direction but luckily
survived

i decided to fall backwards but everything went okay

in other scene it was evening and there were some climbing shits
located directly in the water

and i refused to climb the last ones for some reason or another

in the last scene there were 2 saunas on 2 different floors

but they're not actually floors since there's a fucking sky above so
i'm not sure how it'd work except teleportation

so the girl stayed on the floor above where it was morning i guess and
pretty misty

i went down and it was suddenly fucking evening

i went inside some building that was kinda buried underground and
listened to some announcement i didn't really give a shit about

then i went out and found a giant fucking jukebox

like the size of a vending machine

i selected the album mfsb by mfsb which had a different cover and like
3 extra songs

the first one was non-existent and it played

i think i can even identify the real counterpart

btw i fell asleep at 4 am and i'm dying rn

so i don't forget how it sounded

\*low strings\* \*low strings\* \*low strings\* (slowly) [most likely
the beginning of [Black Frost] by Grover Washington, Jr.]

[Black Frost]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgMiC-o3SRc

\*high strings\* \*high strings\* \*high strings\* \*high strings\*
(fast) [most likely the horn part at 01:04 of [Cold Sweat] by James
Brown but on strings and slower]

[Cold Sweat]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B615TiDdjUc

btw remembered that right to left of that shit near the stairs there
were (i wonder what) a building with a friendly label "PROSTITUTES"

which is weird considering there were children running around

## 2020-04-03

1. it was night and i was watching andrei nifedow's videos

2. it was still night but i was in some school

some people told me about a weird communication method that uses human
hair and "unwraps to 34 km"

also someone told me that they "know everything about me including my
skype account" which i don't even have and i told them that in the
dream

also they said they "gave me the codes to all locker rooms" or
something but i said that i lost them on purpose

## 2020-04-04

there were several [dreams] but i remember only the last one

it was supposedly summer but i was at home playing video games

which is not very far from truth

the game had the word "undertalish" in its name but it had mostly
nothing to do with it

also the graphics were vector i think and the aspect ratio was
adaptive which is absolutely not in the right style

the game itself was set in the southern part of south america and it
was about some boy helping native tribes (are there even any surviving
at this moment) find a source of food

he does some complicated nonsense that inlovles river flow and other
shit and does it

but i think it was just the first level but i'll never know now

also the game had a debug mode or something like it

the only shit stolen from undertale was flowey but he didn't even have
a name and he looked awful with vector graphics (i think he was also
an hidden easter egg hidden in some remote part of the map)

i believe i also fake woke up after that and i saw a video by vsauce2
kevin with a let's play of this game

okay i think i remember 2 dreams before it

not sure in which order

in the first one i sit on a couch with someone in an office-like
building and the bitch tries to take as much space as possible

so i'm angry and have to do the same to compete

but in the end it gets some playful vibes instead

in the second one i assume it was a history lesson but the classroom
looked like a fucking medieval theater

i had problems with picking a seat but i could in the end and it had a
pc with a crt monitor

i didn't do shit with it and some other person decided to seat near me
and it annoyed the fuck out of me

the teacher wasn't even there all the time and in the end the building
got on fucking fire so firefighters were called and we had to get out
by crawling through some dark tunnel

## 2020-04-05

1. outside & winter

i was crossing the same bridge over and over again while listening to
a podcast idk

2. some website

i don't remember anything except the dark green noisy background and
the light theme

3. [the place i'm studying in] at night

before it closed some weird shit was happening and i think its
appearance changed

also i bought food in the entrance hall

the teacher granted me the "right to change the game mode" like in
minecraft but idk why

so i was trying to close everything down especially in the canteen but
couldn't

also a couple of fake wake ups i think

## 2020-04-06

1. me walking around areas similar to ones near my old grandma's house

i think i was trying to find a porn actor for a photo or something

also i was probably attending some classes

swimming perhaps idk but it was uncomfortable and the building was
giant + prolly soviet

2. me traveling with my family

we ran out of something and it was hard to keep going

3. i masturbate in some office building

what the actual fuck

it was really fucking bad

4. it was approximately 1940s and i was a part of a group of children
   to perform on an event that also inlolved stalin

demonstration of nuclear weapons or something

it was dark as fuck and we were supposed to somehow go upstair (yes
one 1.5 meter stair)

i had some shit in my pocket (potato?) and a white handkerchief

also [groupmate] was there and he had a ton of makeup

like on that one picture [the person I'm writing to has] sent me

can't find

in any case i also think i saw stalin himself and he asked from what
direction the enemies can possibly blow up the launcher

also i was blaming myself for giving him some power(?) idk how maybe
this one also involves time travel

please send [that one picture]

[they do]

he had more in the dream

like whiter skin

[about the direction] someone answered from the inside

which i also wanted to answer

but the fucker was faster

## 2020-04-07

there was a tram scene with me any my mom

also one with some cars idk

and one with [the place I'm studying in]

## 2020-04-09

first of all [the person I'm writing to was] there

perhaps not [them] but like an older person similar to [them]

i'd probably say the proctoherbs ad man

[they] worked in a small clinic but i'm not sure if [they] had a
license

[their] paintents include:

mark zuckerberg

this one is especially fucked up because he was bended and [they]
manipulated the insides of his ass using 2 rotating shits or something

random girl

a rat

me?

the clinic itself was located in a small building and i think [they]
used palpatine for advertising (lmao)

also i remember using reddit and seeing people post the results of
image searches with random numbers as a query

i think there was also a second dream but i'm not sure if before or
after

it's like it was blended or something

me and my fucking parents again in a fucking hotel

i'd probably say in turkey or some other similar country

idk for how long we stayed there but by the end of the dream there
were 6 skyscrapers visible right of the window and there was shit
being built all around the settlement

but built with bricks for some reason

## 2020-04-10

1. something about voice impressions

probably by vsauce2 kevin

2. i was younger and also cycling

i just remembered random moments that didn't happen irl and also
ridiculous distances which i rode on my bicycle which i don't even
have

forgot to metion there was a scene where i was in some southern
country and anxiously riding on a bus without paying

## 2020-04-11

me watching reviews for an anime

basically it was about a girl that can time travel

but while she time travels she doesn't move in the absolute space so
she also space travels

while i was doing that i was hearing sounds of my dad developing a
conspiracy theory that coronavirus is bullshit

[fell asleep and woke up again]

1. more shit about this show
2. me watching some disgusting videos on pornhub

one involved someone's grandma and one a fucking dog

also the location was weird

very bright room with pinkish walls

3. fake wake-up

## 2020-04-14

only remember the first one and the last one (fake wake up)

it was a video game where there were 2 clans

the one which name i forgot but they're basically humans and hunters
which i called murderers while playing

i don't remember anything about them except they have an ability to
travel in time and between dimensions or shit but they can't touch the
main one(?) so they pay you(?) to do things for them

the locations themselves were pretty recognizable and insane shit was
of course happening

## 2020-04-15

an awful lot of dreams (at least 3 fake wake ups) but i don't remember
shit

1. i did something which is good for myself but it turned out to be
   bad for someone else so i got in trouble

pretty vague but i can't describe it better

2. computer class scene

there were old crt monitors and the tables were placed near the walls
around the center

someone once said something like "wow just as hard as that terraria
boss" and other person something like "[some girl] isn't doing shit"

3. traveling by train

pretty much sure about fucked up shit but don't remember

also sure there were several more locations

no wait

4. me walking with my dad on a small metal bridge lifted like 50
   meters off the ground

it was summer but there was snow everywhere

also in one place he said that if i fell down i'd die but it actually
wasn't that high

and also that the bridge was much less safe before or something

[The bridge was 1 meter high when viewed from the side and had a
series of alternating 1cm long slits when viewed from the top.]

## 2020-04-16

me wandering around in "the capital of emperial canada"

the city a fuckton of skyscrapers and was huge but in the part i was
in there were only soviet buildings (again) and it was pretty dense

¿that's it?

## 2020-04-17

gigantic underground construction spanning several hundred meters
underground

basically it was made out of blocks twice as high as they're wide and
which were made out of concrete and they formed rooms

the challenge was to get from one remote geographic location to
another by walking through them

i participated

[the person I'm writing to] at least watched videos of previous year's
competitions

btw it wasn't exactly who's faster because no one rushed

also i had to go overground in some canyon

overall pretty interesting

[fell asleep and woke up again]

2. undertale characters as jojo stands

before that i was spying on some company through their hq

and it all happened in a giant mall

i think it was summer and some groupmates were there

also i think in the end the person with asgor murdered someone's
napstablook and the latter had a mental breakdown

and i was like in the spectator mode

it was weird af

## 2020-04-18

too many i forgot most of them [dreams]

1. big guy tried to beat up a small boy but got his ass kicked

the thing happened near some [small] shop probably somewhere in the us

2. [the place I'm studying in] scene

i was going upstrairs with [a groupmate] \[another groupmate] and
probably someone else

[the first one] told me that having gay sex was now fully legal

i didn't understand it because it'd always been legal and tried to ask
him

i don't remember his answer

the dream ended when i entered the classroom

## 2020-04-19

1. something about crime and going through windows

i think there was a weird scene where a guy went through the windows
into some company and complained about door signs

2. me and my father at home while it's raining

the apartment was much smaller than irl and he was watching a crt tv

3. michael stevens having fun with space things

and i was looking at him through the spectator mode

i think he was using a hologram of the solar system or something

## 2020-04-22

me playing video games

also something about jojo's plot

## 2020-04-23

me in my old room with my grandma's old crt tv and much warmer (in
terms of color temperature) lighting

watching youtube videos on my phone

there were (technical) diebuster videos and something else

also borderline porn (haha for educational purposes only :))

## 2020-04-24

fitness courses or something

held my markiplier

i went to him he poured a glass of cold water on me and started
battling me

he finished me pretty quickly and said i was too weak even to be
trained and that i should go someone else first

also i think before going to him i was watching some videos on his
website

## 2020-04-25

1. more family vacation shit

barely remember anything

2. i changed [the place I'm studying in]?

i'm not sure but it looked more like a soviet torture place

the classrooms had no space for legs when sitting so i had to do some
weird shit

the wardrobe was handled by one of my old classmates i'm still scared
of but he didn't recognize me

the whole thing was huge but not high and i have no idea how it worked

also there were reserved couches "in case putin visits us"

to get to the place you had to drive the most unsafe subway station
ever

i remember only the entrance which was located on the other side of
the road and you had to go on a barely functional metallic bridge

and then climb weird metallic stares which didn't make any sense and
were very unsafe

## 2020-04-26

bus station/airport/whatever and god knows what was happening

i remember talking to my dad and crawling through a small tunnel

## 2020-04-27

our [name of a subject] teacher owning us as his household slaves

(i guess) because it was really fuzzy and vague

[fell asleep and woke up again]

i was playing outlast 3 with [one groupmate] and [another groupmate]

the gameplay took place in (what a conincidence) soviet school while
it was day

random npcs were chasing us because we didn't pay something idk

right off the bat i told [the latter groupmate] that i'm going to die
all the time but the npc in the end spared me from completely killing
me by cutting my heart in half with a giant knife on a long stick

wait i think there was something about swapping my room with my
[relative]'s

(bad idea)

## 2020-04-28

i was [the] young [version of our math teacher]

i remember watching tom scott's videos and making a [social media] bot
for some really large conference which i have no idea why i was added
too

the whole thing happened in some mansion which i claimed(?)

[fell asleep and woke up again]

1. the dream had a feeling similar to the previous one

it was about stock manipulation or something i don't remember

2. final battle with thanos

the participants were random and the only thing i remember is some
bunker and probably explosion

also someone was invincible there

## 2020-04-29

only remember one scene:

the main hero who was dressed in some weird shit and who was probably
insane was in a feild covered with snow with some abandoned wooden
building in the middle

then he recieved a call

"Greetings from the official Lüstbahn campaign of Öearsk. If you
recieved this call, this is a great rarity. I know you want to get rid
of that body, and I'm ready to help you. Your name is Chin, right?"

(approximately)

i think the voice was ian mcdiarmid's but i'm not sure

after that there was just random sped up footage of lego star wars for
no reason

[fell asleep and woke up again]

some actually soviet school and i'm a student

i remember a scene with a long line of books on the ground while there
was a chasing and a couple of classroom scenes

[regarding the first dream] btw this was in first person

also i can make a guess that he looked like ed from cowboy bebop

## 2020-04-30

it's pretty fucked up

in the beginning i was lying on my bed which was on the second story
of a 2 story bed but it was closable and the lid was plastic

also it was high as fuck and i could see everything

there were a lot of people and in addition to that i was completely
naked and covered only with a thin paper towel

according to the dream the whole thing happened in the uk and i was
like "it's illegal to be naked in public in the uk so i should do
something or i might get in trouble"

so i went to the shop without money

i have no idea how i wasn't stopped on my way but in the shop itself
someone who looked like something between the rock and jackie chan
helped me with finding clothes and i just ran away without paying

what. the. fuck.

also i think there were a couple of scenes with an avgn-like show and
some multi-story metallic sport shit but i'm not sure when

i think the last one might be a scene a from non-existent pr0n

which makes the whole thing even more cursed

## 2020-05-01

i masturbated on the staircase and cummed all over the place

why the fuck again

this is horrifying

also there was something about my relatives going by car and the
english language but i barely remembered that for an obvious reason

## 2020-05-02

i was an old person taking an interview from a small girl that later
turned out to be a robot

not sure about the topic but there was something about kde the whole
happened indoors and the girl had some plastic shit in her mouth
because she was ashamed of something

i was writing her responses in the gitlab webide i think

also she was a member of "Ъ" whatever that means

[fell asleep and woke up again]

2 guys playing a game about planes and parkour online

the parkour and planes were separate btw

also i think i was helping my dad with windows 10 at the same time and
it looked kinda weird

## 2020-05-03

me skipping classes and doing random shit

i remember walking on the roof and through random corridors and also
browsing the web

in the end i started watching a rip-off of despicable me in italian

also i think just before waking up i saw a picture of obama with some
white text on black background

## 2020-05-04

1. mindless surrreal shit
2. more mindless surreal shit
3. me looking for a computer

according to the dream it happened in england but the building looked
exactly like the place i studied in before

i had a flash stick or something with myself and had a hard time
finding a computer class

i'm not sure if i found it in the end

when i was leaving it was already night and the part of the building
where there was an exit before had been transformed into a clothing
shop so i had to find another one

some random girl that for some reason spoke russian told me that there
was a secret entrance right to the right of me and i just went out

then it switched to the 3rd person view and i was going through grass
while the british version of the fbi was raiding the building because
the welsh had done something

also there were random kids that noticed me because i was using a
flashlight and i guess i fucked up because they rushed right to that
secret door

[fell asleep and woke up again]

4. me watching a video about the "international museum of
shrek" which was in progress of being made

to visit it you needed a vr headset and to be where it was physically
located (khrushyovka)

so basically it's ar

the museum was built by a small team and i guess in this episode they
were having fun

i scrolled to the end of the video first

there was some ghost shit and people dying and after that the guy was
having sex with 2 girls and couldn't choose one

then he said "wait i have an idea"

he opened a portal from which a giant statue of shrek fell in and he
cut the dick off the statue with a sword

i was like "what the fuck" and scrolled to the beginning of the video

there was a couple of guys and they installed a demo game

i remember explosions and probably the game over screen

i think there were like 5 guys including the one who shot the video
and one of them was [my groupmate]

## 2020-05-05

video about a rip-off of bee movie

it had horrible 90s models and animation and someone used them to
promote their clinic or something

[fell asleep and woke up again]

me studying in some village

i had to ride on buses to get to different lessons

also i've seen avgn for some reason

he lived in a barely alive 100 yo house

also i suddenly took a ride to some large city in the middle of the
dream and had troubles with moving my things

weird shit

i think i went to some pool there and almost appeared naked

i don't like the last fact because it's like the 2 second time in row

also to get to that place the bus was going fast as fuck and i was
sitting in the opposite direction so i was kinda scared

## 2020-05-06

forgot but did remember after just waking up

there was something about dreaming and probably paintings

i think there was also some androgynous (could barely spell) person

like a heavy metal player or shit

## 2020-05-07

something really weird related to computers

there was a scene where i returned back home after getting out to
check something and one where i helped my dad with his os

also for some reason one where i checked the stock prices and one
where i pissed into a toilet with no hole

it's hard to explain but basically it's just a room where everyone
shits on the floor

it was on some (construction?) site and it was really hard not to step
in shit

also the (wooden) door didn't close and didn't have the upper half +
an old guy was in a line after me

btw the floor wasn't perfectly flat and it made it even worse

[fell asleep and woke up again]

me walking down the street and remembering weird shit

when i came home it turned out someone made me instant noodles 3 days
ago and freezed them

and also that for no reason my grandma gifted me some really weird
underwear

i think while i was walking there was also something about a
non-existent anime

the only thing i remember is random characters from the

fuck i forgot the name

incredibles

or is it i'm not sure some disney shit

and also both main characters from gunbuster and kill la kill

why the fuck idk

someone tried to kill someone else with fire but in the end it didn't
happen

[The person I'm writing to mentions the "weird underwear" and sends a
picture of a guy with his underwear perfectly stretched around his
boner.]

no it was like

uhhhhhh how do i even say

i mean you put them on in two passes

and they weirdly wrap around you

(your dick area)

but there remains a horizontal hole near the top when they're on

and when they're not on they look like a mostly flat piece of cloth
shit with 3 holes in it

[They ask me to draw it.]

i can't because it's too fucked up

i'm not even sure how i exactly put them on

[They don't understand how it works.]

me neither

## 2020-05-08

some classes idk

i was writing something in html (on paper?) while the teacher was
screaming at someone

for some reason i was involuntarily slowly standing up the whole time
but no one noticed

in the end i installed a scottish theme for my phone and for some
reason everyone including the teacher really really hated it

i think before i fell asleep the second time there was a dream with
something about transgender people and my parents

i think the teacher looked something between the russian one and the
chemistry one

and the classroom was a generic soviet shit with green walls

## 2020-05-09

playing a hyper realistic minecraft-like game

then something related to my cat and my sister happened

and then i was in some building near the pool where they managed to
hide multiple floors on 1 floor using complicated tricks

## 2020-05-10

an alien arrived on earth and discovered that if you punch humans too
hard they die

and the humans developed the anti-punch fabric and glass

while that was happening i was in my grandma's old house

also there was something about firefox and how large windows in
restaurants are bad because they stimulate anxiety and are easier for
terrorists to break

(what)

wait i remembered the dream before that

there was a space opera a horrorish shit and a minecraft shit

in the last one in the end steve came out of a hole in the ground
filled with blood and corpses of the killed mobs and arrived at
someone's house

the owner of the house pushed steve back into the hole and he fell
down and died
