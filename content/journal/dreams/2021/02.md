## 2021-02-03

there were 2 buildings one of which was somehow related to me

the one that wasn't became a tourist attraction but mine didn't
because of architecture or some shit

also it was closed in the end i think and me and the guys were going
there

the whole thing reminds me of putin's palace

we were moving into another apartment so were in the process of moving
things

on my computer i had a gnome-like de installed and some weird shit was
happening to it

the clipboard and some critial component were connected in a
non-obvious way

also several groupmates were there

just remembered that a groupmate and i were comparing our cock sizes

mine was bigger

first i was watching some really weird youtube videos

they were from some japanese tv show about technology

then i started searching for hentai but on some completely unrelated
website

then i started making up a concept for a jjba-like show

it was about a punky boy who was living under an opressive military
government and he was resisting against it

he and other people had a super power of being able to use math to
modify the real world

like they could move through the walls become invisible and battle
each other

how successful they were at that depended on their level
