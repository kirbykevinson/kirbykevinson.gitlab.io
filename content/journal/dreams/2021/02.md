## 2021-02-03

there were 2 buildings one of which was somehow related to me

the one that wasn't became a tourist attraction but mine didn't
because of architecture or some shit

also it was closed in the end i think and me and the guys were going
there

the whole thing reminds me of putin's palace

## 2021-02-05

we were moving into another apartment so were in the process of moving
things

on my computer i had a gnome-like de installed and some weird shit was
happening to it

the clipboard and some critial component were connected in a
non-obvious way

also several groupmates were there

just remembered that a groupmate and i were comparing our cock sizes

mine was bigger
