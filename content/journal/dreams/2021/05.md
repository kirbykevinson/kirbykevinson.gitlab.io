1. the city nearby

i was either with my family or a groupmate

we had troubles entering it because we had a foreign person

or we were foreign

idk some messed up shit

the passport checking process or whatever was weird

like they ranked us on how likely we are to pass

2. video game

or maybe a tv show but prolly not

it was really long and had multiple plot lines going at the same time

in one of them a guy tries to rebuild the civilization on a deserted
island

there was also one that was related to me

but i'm not sure how

in one you had to shoot people coming from a plane

3. hospital

this dream may actually be the continuation of the previous one

or maybe even a plot line of it i'm not sure

so in any case i was in a hospital

they were helping me with transitioning

i don't remember what exactly happened but i did feel like a girl

pretty cool
