1. neocities

it had a much simpler black on white 1.0 design

also there were such features as website reviews and chat

most of the sites were random except one where some girl asks a bunch
of questions and possibly macedev

i answered to the first one with just "No." in the review

kyle drake had an important role in this dream so i probably contacted
him or something

2. a game by valve

it was basically a real life simulator

the whole game depended on how you start and continue it

i remember a couple of scenes

a beginning on the game where i was some 70s guy in a band

a middle of the game where i'm on some public square and it had kde
marked buildings

an ending of the game where i had to kill some girl so something
terrible doesn't happen

an ending where i had to blow up a giant laboratory

it had portal 2 vibes

the game had an ability to save at any point which i actively used

at some point i tried to recreate my life there but got bored and
started googling interesting things about the game instead

the game had the word sim in its name

something like ssim or simsim

3. dreams i forgot

there were like 2 of them maybe

but i do remember one scene where i open up the messages and there are
over a thousand new messages from [friend]

new dreams:

1. trains

i was riding them

there was a black girl with me

not sure what she was doing

2. ptoilet

that's the name of the game

i was trying to find it but apparently it got removed

because it used a proprietary algorithm for calculating some shit

there were at least 4 dreams between them

i tried to recall them but failed

there was something related to my family and music in one of them

probably the 4th one

## 2021-03-03

it was my old school but with current groupmates

specifically [friend] was sitting next to me on a couch

we had cursive writing lessons and they were so bad i thought about
killing myself

considering the couch i'm not sure what kind of classroom it was

on some point i think we were on the roof and the couch was hanging of
it

oh i remembered another dream

[another friend's gf] allowed me to look at her phone

it was an android phone but it could transform into a dumb phone

like it had a touchscreen and slidable buttons

hey another dream

it was about neocities

a redesign was made available to registered users

it used a light green palette and had more elements

also i forgot to pay the monthly fee so i got a notification

## 2021-03-04

it was about an nes game that was apparently a prequel to tus

but it looked nothing like it

i think i've seen an avgn review about it or a related game

also he was fat for some reason

also there was a hacker news post discussing it

## 2021-03-07

1. some controversy about twosetviolin

there was an apology video

2. trying to quietly mastrubate in the bathroom while my relative
   doesn't let me to

great

## 2021-03-10

it was about parallel worlds

like some people had an ability to go into one and do something there

i think i was one of them assuming i even was a protagonist there

i think there was a family in that world with which i contacted

i don't remember any details

also there was a cute lizard

i called it a gecko but it was another species

i think it happened near a lake in the real world and in the parallel
world we were driving somewhere

and the plot was about losing a thing in the parallel world or
something

video games

there were 2 nes games with extremely hard bosses

prolly they were mario hacks

there was also a modern game

i saw it in first person so it was prolly a vr game

there were weird challenges like climbing an extremely tall ladder

i was playing with some friends and i was the only one to complete
this one

later we went into some gaming club

there were a couple of interesting games there which i played

i think there was 1 friend with me

the dream had more interesting scenes but i already forgot them

## 2021-03-13

too much shit

i forgot the vast majority of it

1. vacation in turkey

i remember going to the beach

nothing out of ordinary happened i think

2. making up the plot for that one secret writing project

i think i made it really similar to the star wars trilogy

the main character's power were progressively growing just as the
villain's

also it was mostly in space which doesn't work well with what i
already made up

there was a chemical that was giving the main character power and was
used by the villain for their shit

so essentially unobtanium but it was called something like suggestium

the story begins with pigeons in japan dying and ends with the
universe collapsing

pretty cool i'd say

3. some self-aware bullshit

like i was sleeping during the day there while i was actually sleeping
during the day
