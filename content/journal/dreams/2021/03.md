1. neocities

it had a much simpler black on white 1.0 design

also there were such features as website reviews and chat

most of the sites were random except one where some girl asks a bunch
of questions and possibly macedev

i answered to the first one with just "No." in the review

kyle drake had an important role in this dream so i probably contacted
him or something

2. a game by valve

it was basically a real life simulator

the whole game depended on how you start and continue it

i remember a couple of scenes

a beginning on the game where i was some 70s guy in a band

a middle of the game where i'm on some public square and it had kde
marked buildings

an ending of the game where i had to kill some girl so something
terrible doesn't happen

an ending where i had to blow up a giant laboratory

it had portal 2 vibes

the game had an ability to save at any point which i actively used

at some point i tried to recreate my life there but got bored and
started googling interesting things about the game instead

the game had the word sim in its name

something like ssim or simsim

3. dreams i forgot

there were like 2 of them maybe

but i do remember one scene where i open up the messages and there are
over a thousand new messages from [friend]
