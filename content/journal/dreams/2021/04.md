i was in some sort of mall and was looking through a catalog

i was looking for point and click games but there were none despite
all of other games being casual

i even tried the search function (how) but it yielded nothing

maybe it was because the whole thing was in russian and i typed the
name of the genre in english

in any case i didn't find shit and decided to search somewhere else

i went to the shop nearby and it appeared that they did sell video
games

i asked the cashier to find me some point and click games and she said
that they had one

she brought me a whole game console and started unpacking it from the
cardboard box

the console was basically a red crt tv with a built-in computer meant
to run a single game

the computer ran freebsd with libwayland but different from the irl
library with the same name

it was something like wlroots meaning it was a compositor not a
protocol library

she said the console was made by a russian developer in 2017 and it
surprised me that they used wayland back then

then the game itself loaded and it wasn't quite what i was i expecting

it was in low resolution and was using only like 16 colors which
looked as if it was a game for an early pc

the game itself was a story about some boy going into the forest and
doing some shit

it was in 3rd person and you could move the character which makes no
sense for a point and click game

weird shit was happening between levels like a giant baby appearing on
the screen and exploding

i completed the whole game in the shop while sitting on the floor with
the cashier

i was ranting sort of like avgn during the whole thing and she was
listening to me

in the end i said that the game kinda sucked and i expected something
better

then it suddenly switched into the 3rd person i was replaced by some
guy in his 30s

she said that she was recording my rant and showed a vhs tape

the guy pulled in his adam's apple changing his voice into a more
feminine one

i guess he was like "nope that absolutely wasn't me"

i was failing my exams

it was either english or russian i'm not sure

you had to write a story or something based on given info

there were several tasks like this and i couldn't do any

i had a mental breakdown but they offered me another attempt

i think i still couldn't do shit

there was a scene where i was near a mall and i was flying

new dream:

i was somewhere and i was satisfied about it

i forgot everything else because some fucker woke me up

oh shit i remembered other dreams

1. weird shit

i was consuming fan-made gunbuster content

i think it had a demo version and i found out how to unlock the full
one

i also found out the author and i think i've met them

he was a fat guy with eyeglasses

also there was a scene where i was shitting in a port-o-potty

it was a weird one because there was no hole and the feces were
supposed to be washed off

2. movie/video game about fish

or maybe not fish but underwater humans or something

i think you could become one using the arthur and the invisibles
method

basically there was a giant underwater city and a story was told about
it

i was controlling a protagonist that looked like the main guy from
shark tale

there was a subway system and i think i was employed at a restaurant

i also had an ability to record and save videos so i guess i had a
camera or something

at the end of the dream i and some other guys were at a parkour stage
and there were secrets

## 2021-04-08

it was some sort of video game

it was in 3d and was about the main character getting into a parallel
dimension

i don't remember anything about it expect that the was an undyne-like
character

i mean a strong armored woman that wants to fight you

i'm not sure if she was a human but she had green armor

there was another video game after i finished this one

i woke up before the first cutscene ended

it was about a guy surviving on his own in a deserted forest in the
winter

he had a talking robot head with him that was annoying him

it looked like c3po's but was transparent

1. interfering with a perfomance

it was in the college i think and they invited random artists

so they were preparing or something and i think it happened in the
basement

i just ran in there and started doing random shit

i'm not sure if i got kicked out by the end

2. waterpark?

it was still related to college and there were random students

so it was their project or something like this i'm not sure

there were slides of course and they needed compressors running which
were controlled by the students

i had some fun sliding down with people but then came back there after
it was closed to see how it worked

3. weird shit

basically it was several dreams mixed together with seamless
transitions

so basically a fever dream

so first there was an alternative take from star wars the last jedi

there were more cool space scenes and in the main battle scene the
main characters just fucking kill themselves

they ram their ship into the first order's at-ats and i guess both of
them die

then suddenly it was not about star wars but about a war on mars
between 2 colonies

basically they sacrificed themselves but saved some chick that became
their leader later

she had a star warsish name and when the battle happened she was a
child

there was a scene with futuristic mars shit who cares

then it transitioned to mars scenery which somehow became british
scenery

it was a deserted beach with rocks reinforced by metal

it was supposed to be old london but it looked more like a random
prehistoric town

so there was a railway running through this place and there were
manholes in the rails that you could swim in

there were supposedly no trains running but i still decided not to
risk because it'd dangerous

then there was a segment about a built-in communication system into
those rails

like they could recieve electric signals and you could call people
with it

it was apparently most actively used in the 80s but that sounds absurd

there was a scene where a grandma on a train was calling someone and
it was a demonstration of some sort

you had 2 phone dials on each side of your sit and you had to properly
use them in the right order

so i guess it was something along the lines of the fact that they have
2 different water taps in britain but more ridiculous

there were 2 more scenes but i'm not sure how they fit this dream

one was about me finding videos from my old youtube channel reuploaded

i cringed and closed the thing and decided to watch it later

it happened sort of like between the mars and britain thing but idk how

i was lying on a beach alone with my phone when it just happened

the other scene was from a star wars-like show and i have no clue how
it fits there

so it was basically a darth vader - palpatine kind of trope but i'm
not sure if they were the good or the bad guys

some shit happened and they had to contact their palpatine which would
be extremely angry about it

both of the bosses were again strong armored undyne-like women and the
mainer one was in her own room

why do i even get them in my dreams

do i like strong women so much

in any case that's about it with my dreams

## 2021-04-10

it was about a 90s style linux de

i tried to implement window shadows

i pushed the changes to git but later i fucked up and rolled back to a
very old commit and didn't know how to go back

i think there also was an irl scene where i was walking somewhere

## 2021-04-11

4chan

## 2021-04-12

playing mario

it was allegedly a sequel to smb1 but if was different

it reminded me of some game boy game

alao before that there was a weird dream

idk how to even describe it

like i could make some shit happen and it was related to the person's
dreams?

idk but it was in a hotel of some sort and i got my ass kicked for
using this ability

## 2021-04-13

1. it was about an avgn episode from february 2005

it was about nes and the episode looked pretty modern

i think i've only seen like 2 seconds of the episode

2. walking through an american town

it looked pretty deserted like no one lived there since the 80s

i was talking with some guy over the phone

he was talking about monitors and connecting stuff to them

i think i was going to buy a dendy or something

3. going with my dad somewhere

he was driving the car and everything was pretty chill

don't remember much else

okay wait i do

it was about a lake

it was a few kilometers outside the city

the lake was pretty shitty and guarded by police for some reason

i think i refused to swim there

4. video game about time travel

it had a top-down view and nes-like graphics

there were generic enemies and cool bugs where you could clip through
the walls

there were 2 main characters a teenager and his grandpa

also they had a friend bob (with a nickname drawie) that was born in
1944

they lose his friend while one of time travels

later 2 films were shot based on this game

5. working on the group project

i was adding some really weird shit to the viewer

that's about it
