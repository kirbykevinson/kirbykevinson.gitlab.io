## 2021-07-01

it was in college and we had the last class of some sort

it was either math or english i'm not sure

i spent the entire class in the restroom shitting

the restroom looked much better than the actual one we have

probably it was a staff restroom as there was only 1 stall

my mom called me while i was there

also the english teacher somehow opened the door to see if i'm
actually shitting

after the class ended i stopped shitting and went outside

some people were with me

prolly friends but not the ones i have irl

we started looking for shawarma which there were places with nearby

but instead of buying one we went to another nearby college

there were random 2 guys on a jungle gym

i said something that made them suddenly unhappy

then suddenly the entire fucking place got flooded and the water moved
us to the shore

they were like "haha happens all the time"

then a random guy that was with them started eating weird cookies

he then transformed into a cookie-like humanoid and said something
with a robotic voice

i for some reason thought it was a reference to an undertale character

i was playing video games and searching stuff about them online

the first video game was a 2d game for windows 9x

it was about a boy in some town

it had a very unique calm vibe

i was at the end of the game

you had to solve a puzzle to actually complete it

the second game was a 3d one

i think it was for playstation 1 or 2

i'm not sure what the game was about but it had a darker atmosphere

there were easter eggs in the game that displayed a "web page"

people online recreated them using actual html and css

they also made pages inspired by them and i made one too
