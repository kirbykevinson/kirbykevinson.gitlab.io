## 2021-07-01

it was in college and we had the last class of some sort

it was either math or english i'm not sure

i spent the entire class in the restroom shitting

the restroom looked much better than the actual one we have

probably it was a staff restroom as there was only 1 stall

my mom called me while i was there

also the english teacher somehow opened the door to see if i'm
actually shitting

after the class ended i stopped shitting and went outside

some people were with me

prolly friends but not the ones i have irl

we started looking for shawarma which there were places with nearby

but instead of buying one we went to another nearby college

there were random 2 guys on a jungle gym

i said something that made them suddenly unhappy

then suddenly the entire fucking place got flooded and the water moved
us to the shore

they were like "haha happens all the time"

then a random guy that was with them started eating weird cookies

he then transformed into a cookie-like humanoid and said something
with a robotic voice

i for some reason thought it was a reference to an undertale character

i was playing video games and searching stuff about them online

the first video game was a 2d game for windows 9x

it was about a boy in some town

it had a very unique calm vibe

i was at the end of the game

you had to solve a puzzle to actually complete it

the second game was a 3d one

i think it was for playstation 1 or 2

i'm not sure what the game was about but it had a darker atmosphere

there were easter eggs in the game that displayed a "web page"

people online recreated them using actual html and css

they also made pages inspired by them and i made one too

it was a movie about animals

you know like madagascar

i don't remember the exact name but it was something along the lines
of "animal mess"

the main character was a fox and the villain was a skunk

or maybe not i'm not sure

in the beginning the villain stole something from the mc and they were
chasing each other

the villain managed to escape

so the rest of the movie was the mc looking for surveillance footage
to find where he escaped

doesn't sound too fun but it kinda was

he ran into many obstacles on his way

i think there was a scene with a closed electronic shop

there were several dreams but i already don't remember them

but one thing that they did have in common was a featured non-existent
css property

it was called something like image-crop and controlled image
viewporting

basically it acted like object-fit but was a bit different

there were multiple dreams but i remember only the last one

all of the dreams were about programming

the one i remember took place in my grandma's apartment

there were my mom and some kind of prodigy fucker

he was really young and also had black skin

he was discussing an unofficial homm3 engine written in c

i remember he showed me how some variadic function worked

the engine itself was different from vcmi

it was more complete and more frequently updated

though its website was much more bare bones

regular college day

i was ignoring the class and doing shit on my laptop

then the pe class started and it turned out i forgot my laptop

i asked my friend and he told me that i forgot it in the restroom

i went back to the 7th floor and entered the restroom

there were no laptop so i decided to take a piss in any case

the toilets looked more like plastic bowls on which you can't seat

someone started narrating what was happening in my head

they referred to the toilet as a "pointing device"

there were multiple dreams most of which i forgot

they had one thing in common but i don't quite remember which

probably it was some logo

1. minecraft clone

someone was writing it and i was watching it

that someone could also be me

the game was in it's very early stages

compared to minecraft's early classic

only terrain generation was done and the game didn't even have a name

i thought of proposing tusse because why not

the creator was trying to make the grass texture out of a photo of
some rock

i think they noticed that someone used it in another game this way

they failed but i think they produced a texture by different means in
the end

2. spaceship

not much to say here because i don't remember shit

i think i might have been doing some maintenance work there

you know like programming

also i think the ship had artificial gravity

the walls inside were painted dark blue and there were giant windows

i remember a hall that probably acted as an observatory of some sort

3. bass playing lessons

it wasn't at home but rather some school

the room where it happened fit many people so maybe it was a group
lesson

i remember that at least one groupmate was there

she told me to play something and i of course failed

i didn't even know where the notes are so i was desperately trying to
find them on a chart

i think i was trying for so long that i was there even when the class
ended
