## 2021-07-01

it was in college and we had the last class of some sort

it was either math or english i'm not sure

i spent the entire class in the restroom shitting

the restroom looked much better than the actual one we have

probably it was a staff restroom as there was only 1 stall

my mom called me while i was there

also the english teacher somehow opened the door to see if i'm
actually shitting

after the class ended i stopped shitting and went outside

some people were with me

prolly friends but not the ones i have irl

we started looking for shawarma which there were places with nearby

but instead of buying one we went to another nearby college

there were random 2 guys on a jungle gym

i said something that made them suddenly unhappy

then suddenly the entire fucking place got flooded and the water moved
us to the shore

they were like "haha happens all the time"

then a random guy that was with them started eating weird cookies

he then transformed into a cookie-like humanoid and said something
with a robotic voice

i for some reason thought it was a reference to an undertale character

i was playing video games and searching stuff about them online

the first video game was a 2d game for windows 9x

it was about a boy in some town

it had a very unique calm vibe

i was at the end of the game

you had to solve a puzzle to actually complete it

the second game was a 3d one

i think it was for playstation 1 or 2

i'm not sure what the game was about but it had a darker atmosphere

there were easter eggs in the game that displayed a "web page"

people online recreated them using actual html and css

they also made pages inspired by them and i made one too

it was a movie about animals

you know like madagascar

i don't remember the exact name but it was something along the lines
of "animal mess"

the main character was a fox and the villain was a skunk

or maybe not i'm not sure

in the beginning the villain stole something from the mc and they were
chasing each other

the villain managed to escape

so the rest of the movie was the mc looking for surveillance footage
to find where he escaped

doesn't sound too fun but it kinda was

he ran into many obstacles on his way

i think there was a scene with a closed electronic shop

there were several dreams but i already don't remember them

but one thing that they did have in common was a featured non-existent
css property

it was called something like image-crop and controlled image
viewporting

basically it acted like object-fit but was a bit different
