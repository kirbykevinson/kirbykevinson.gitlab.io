## 2021-01-01

there were 3 of them 2 of which i forgot

i falsely woke up and was retelling them here but for some reason by
writing in paint and drawing crappy anime shit

in the dream i remembered a guy lived near a lake in moscow

even in the summer it was too cold to swim in there so he put a
swimming pool inside the lake

somehow i had a sense of temperature and it wasn't actually cold
outside the pool

working as a trolleybus conductor with [friend]'s mom as a partner

i jumped on the trolleybus nearly late and when i did it it was early
morning

his mom prolly didn't look true to life but she was slim and looked
pretty old and wrinkly

i didn't even know the schedule so i asked her

we stopped on some stop (and it was already day somehow) and she went
to ask someone

the driver however didn't stop driving and started going in circles
around the place (i'm not sure if we had any passengers at this point)

he started going only faster and faster and in the end we were flying
through the air

i woke up just before we crashed into the ground

there was another dream where my dad and i were going somewhere but i
don't remember anything except that there was something about shoes
