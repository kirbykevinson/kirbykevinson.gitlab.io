## 2021-01-01

there were 3 of them 2 of which i forgot

i falsely woke up and was retelling them here but for some reason by
writing in paint and drawing crappy anime shit

in the dream i remembered a guy lived near a lake in moscow

even in the summer it was too cold to swim in there so he put a
swimming pool inside the lake

somehow i had a sense of temperature and it wasn't actually cold
outside the pool

working as a trolleybus conductor with [friend]'s mom as a partner

i jumped on the trolleybus nearly late and when i did it it was early
morning

his mom prolly didn't look true to life but she was slim and looked
pretty old and wrinkly

i didn't even know the schedule so i asked her

we stopped on some stop (and it was already day somehow) and she went
to ask someone

the driver however didn't stop driving and started going in circles
around the place (i'm not sure if we had any passengers at this point)

he started going only faster and faster and in the end we were flying
through the air

i woke up just before we crashed into the ground

there was another dream where my dad and i were going somewhere but i
don't remember anything except that there was something about shoes

## 2021-01-03

first i was in some waterpark with the slides going around the walls

i'm not sure how the whole thing could serve more than one person on a
slide on a time but whatever

i was there for some time then i went to another section of the park
where there was a model of a ship from which you should jump off

i think there were several such ships and some of the groupmates were
there

everything went fine until i realized that one of my former classmates
(i think her name is anya) is dead (but not irl)

i went to her house and yes she was indeed dead according to her
relatives

then i went home and while i was walking i was thinking about how my
grandma wants me to marry a straight white woman and have children
with her while i don't want that

when i arrived home there was some guy on my computer (with the
monitor i gave my sister for some reason) working on music

i somehow agreed to gift him my computer and leave only the laptop for
myself and started preparing to install windows on the thing

then i started discussing the waterpark thing with the groupmates

not sure in what conference because there were some people that are
not in our local one

it was pretty generic except one message about the sexual orientation

the whole thing ended with someone discovering a link to some
teacher's profile or a video or whatever
