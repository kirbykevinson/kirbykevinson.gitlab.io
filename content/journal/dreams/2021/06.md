i was writing a wayland proxy library

basically it allowed clients to use color formats that aren't
supported by the compositor

later i wrote a plugin for some tweaking tool that used this library

i later found out that microsoft forked that tool

there was also some video game

i'm not sure if it was 2d or 3d but it was from the 90s

i think there was also something about angry birds

which makes sense because i played it yesterday

so the dream wasn't about me but some random guy

it was about his dreams so like it was a dream in a dream for me

he had super powers and an ability to replay the dream/read its script
or whatever

in one of the dreams he found other people like him and his
non-existent grandma

they combined their powers and broke from the dream and came into the
real world

also there was a dream where he was in a marshrutka

it was outside of the city and the driver forgot to close the door

he asked the driver to close it but he didn't care
