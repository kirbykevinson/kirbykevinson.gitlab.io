i was writing a wayland proxy library

basically it allowed clients to use color formats that aren't
supported by the compositor

later i wrote a plugin for some tweaking tool that used this library

i later found out that microsoft forked that tool

there was also some video game

i'm not sure if it was 2d or 3d but it was from the 90s

i think there was also something about angry birds

which makes sense because i played it yesterday

so the dream wasn't about me but some random guy

it was about his dreams so like it was a dream in a dream for me

he had super powers and an ability to replay the dream/read its script
or whatever

in one of the dreams he found other people like him and his
non-existent grandma

they combined their powers and broke from the dream and came into the
real world

also there was a dream where he was in a marshrutka

it was outside of the city and the driver forgot to close the door

he asked the driver to close it but he didn't care

1. video about google's failed camera

actually there were two cameras with similar names

they were released several years apart and both failed

in the video the guy was talking about them in his office

2. researching some shit

i think it was about surviving in the wild

though i'm not sure cause i forgot most of it

i was watching youtube videos and reading a paper

the paper was uploaded on the website of some university

the link was broken so i had to repair it myself

the pages had only basic html formatting

3. youtube playlist of weird videos

so in that dream i apparently was sleeping and then woke up

and the playlist somehow contained videos related to my "dreams"

also there was a scene where my grandma gave me an F in my record book
because i hadn't attended something

1. writing some wayland shit

i think i was implementing some drm-related protocol

specifically it required turning off all of the monitors except the
main one

2. at least 3 dreams that i forgot

3. watching star wars

like all 6 movies

in order from 1 to 6

the films looked nothing like original

they were much more casual

i think i also watched the director's commentary where he explained
the meanings of the words

4. playing minecraft with my friend

he used nbt editing to apply some spell to track me

i got rid of it using /clear
