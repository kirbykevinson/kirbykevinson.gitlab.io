Almost every dream description is transported either from social media
messages or notes as-is, so everything's a little bit fucked up and
contains a lot of errors.

Most of my dreams have washed-out colors, are usually in first-person
view and set in vast open spaces with, for some reason, a lot of
soviet architecture and ｔｒａｉｎｓ. Also I've had only [one dream]
with music or anything like it so far, and I often falsely wake up,
something several times in a dream.
