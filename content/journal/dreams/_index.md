Almost every dream description is transported either from social media
messages or notes as-is, so everything's a little bit fucked up and
contains a lot of errors.

Most of my dreams have washed-out colors, are usually in first-person
view and set in vast open spaces with, for some reason, a lot of
soviet architecture and ｔｒａｉｎｓ. Also none have music or anything
like it in any form.
