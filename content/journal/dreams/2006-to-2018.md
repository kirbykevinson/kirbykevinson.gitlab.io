## 2006-XX-XX

This is the oldest dream I remember. I drive on a bus to some
waterfall, where water falls through some natural stone pillars. The
atmosphere was very misty and absolutely not depressive.

## 20XX-XX-XX

I just got rolled over by a giant steel ball on a road. Or maybe I
didn't because I woke up too soon.

## 201X-XX-XX

Random shit with Outlast-like gas chamber door thingies and labs.

## 2018-XX-XX

I was in a poor African village and tried to escape, but some people
stopped me in the airport and forced to make a website for a christian
doctor that looked like Sheev Palpatine. It looked approximately like
[this] \(the text there is, of course, made up, but everything else is
as accurate as I could make by [wasting 2 hours in GIMP] and then
wasting a whole day almost 2 years later).

## 2018-XX-XX

This one is now known as "The Shrek Dream". The sexual intercourse
with him happened on my grandma's old couch, and I was in the cowgirl
position. I'm not sure what kind of genitals both of us had.
