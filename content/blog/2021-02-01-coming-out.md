I'm transgender.

## Frequently asked questions

### Are you kidding?

No.

### I'm not happy about it

Well, there's not much I can do about it. Deal with it.

### Who are you sexually attracted to?

Mostly women.

### How did you realize that?

Since I was a child, I've had a great desire to be a girl, but I
always dismissed it as unrealistic. In 2019 I learned about The Trans
Thingâ„¢, but I was managing to convince myself that there's no way I
can be trans and I'm just a femboy. In early March 2020 my mom made a
comment on my nail length and said something along the lines of "are
you questioning your gender identity", and it finally cracked me.

### What's your transition plan?

I'm gonna do what I've gotta do, and no one can stop me.
