Now when you know some of the things I hate ([1], [2]), it's time for
you to know about the things I like. And get ready because this time
they're much more controversial and also sorted in a descending order.

## Deplatforming

Yes, I'm making a comment on an actual political issue despite being
far from an expect in it. I know it may not turn too well, but I'd
rather be transparent to you.

First, let's clear up a couple of things:

* I do support free speech, but I acknowledge that it’s not free of
  consequences and doesn’t mean a guarantee of a certain way of it to
  be presented.
* I do still support decentralization despite it making harder to
  deplatform things as it’s highly benifitical for the democracy and
  resisting monopolization.

So the basic idea of deplatforming is that groups promoting hateful
ideas (for example, violence) should be removed from social media and
other platforms, thus "deplatformed." To do this, the companies employ
their abilitiy to restrict their platform and remove content the
content they deem inappropriate, also known as "moderation." This is
allowed to happen because free speech doesn't apply to private
companies, and the people who don't support deplatforming are arguing
that it should, so the companies are not able to censor any ideas. I,
however, don't support this idea for one simple reason: it'll do much
more harm than benifit us. Aside from being necessary to limit the
conversation from offtopic content, moderation is extremely useful for
eliminating toxicity on the platforms. Even when done poorly,
moderation prevents everything going completely apeshit because of
overflowing by loud hateful vocal minorities. Should you remove the
ability of private companies to do it, *every platform* will turn
extremely toxic. There would be just no place for a normal
conversation, which will affect the crime rate and will further propel
the spreading of extremist ideologies. This should not be allowed to
happen.

One argument that I've heard against it is "I would rather accept
hateful groups on the platform and let their ideas be challenged by
facts and logic," however it wouldn't work. No one will give a shit
about facts and logic when they have an advantage of being popular.
There's no other way to get rid of them other than isolate them to
their own platforms, where their ideas slowly decade and die in peace.

## systemd

[TLDR](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths)

systemd is a prime example of a software controversy made for
absolutely no fucking reason, and it's so funny. Here are some of the
bullshit arguments that are used against it and why they're wrong:

* It's monolithic? I have no idea why some people believe it, but
  basically they think that systemd is one big fat binary that
  encompases all the features. It's not. The project consists of
  several dozen of standalone services that, by the most part, work
  independently of each other and can easily be disabled or replaced.
  It's quite far away from "all or nothing" and is similar in this
  aspect to the Linux kernel.
* It's bloated? Are you kidding me? Have you actually looked at the
  systemd services and the features they provide? For example, take a
  look at [timesyncd] or [networkd]. That, in my opinion, is quite
  minimalist and even feature lacking in some aspects. Projects like
  [chrony] and [NetworkManager] are much more feature complete, but no
  one has any complaints to them. And here I'm not even talking about
  services like localed or hostnamed that barely even count as
  services because they're like 3 lines of code that don't even sit in
  the background.
* It's complex? Yes, it is technically more complex than previous
  projects, but its complexity is justified by its helpful features,
  just like for many other software. Welcome to the modern world.
* It doesn't follow the Unix way? It uses plain text for
  configuration and consists of many small programs that can be used
  together to do the job. Sounds pretty Unix to me. But even if it
  didn't follow it, let's just admit to ourselves that Unix is dead
  for good. What we have now is Linux and we should make the best out
  of it and not just blindly follow the principles from a prehistoric
  OS.
* It's a feature creep? systemd promises to provide a set of
  low-level basic building blocks for a Linux system that allows it to
  run and be administered. As you can see, it does what it promises
  and nothing more. Just because all those tools are under a single
  name doesn't mean it's a feature creep. BSD does the same thing, but
  no one complains there.
* It forces people to use it? It does but by using the fair technique
  of being so useful that people actually use it. No one is
  technically holding a gun near your head and forces you to use it,
  and you're free to make a systemd-free distro. Just, please, don't
  complain when people don't want to support you because they have no
  obligation to do so for you.

[networkd]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-networkd
[chrony]: https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/
[NetworkManager]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager

And here are the reasons why I really like it:

* It's so much more convenient. systemd makes it much easier to do
  many things like, for example, reading logs of everything and
  analyzing your system. Every instrument is systemd's toolbox has a
  uniform well-documented interface that's a pleasure to use.
* It's more robust. systemd employs a declarative system for its
  configuration, which more resistent to errors than executing
  arbitrary shell crap.
* It allows for more clever techniques. One of them, for example, is
  socket activation, which allows to launch services on demand instead
  just letting them sit in the background forever. Another one is
  containerization, which allows you to limit the capabilities of the
  services, making them less vulnerable.
* It unifies the ecosystem. Now when almost every distro uses systemd
  you don't have to worry about making a certain thing just work
  accross all the systems, because it now just does.

## Not wiping your ass

Yes, I am not kidding. Just bear with me.

Wiping your ass with toilet paper is basically the worst thing you can
do to it. Instead of actually getting rid of the feces, you just smear
them while irritating your skin. Considering how people usually wipe,
in the end you're just left with a barely cleaned ass. What's the
solution to this, you might ask? Well, it's obvious - washing it
instead. I've been doing it since I was a child, and I've had
absolutely no problems so far. My ass is about as clean as it can get
and my anal hygiene is incredibly simple while yielding great results.

## Airplane food

Disclaimer: I've only ever flown cheap Russian airlines, so I have no
idea about the situation in the rest of the world, but it's probably
even better.

This one is kind of hard to explain because tastes are personal, but
basically I think airplane food is not only good but also superior to
regular food you can get in a restaurant or cook at home. Here are my
extremely subjective reasons:

* It has a unique taste you can't get anywhere else. Apparently,
  because of the high altitude, and dry air the food doesn't taste as
  prominent as regular food. You may not like it, but I absolutely
  love it. It makes the food taste just so much better for me, and I
  would be incredibly happy if there was a way to recreate it at home.
* It's given to you in a small portion that's just enough to make you
  feel satisfied. You have to make the best out of little things you
  have and enjoy them.
* It's presented at the best time possible. After you've gone through
  all of the nightmare that is modern airport and waited through a
  portion of the flight, you get hungry and sad, but then you're given
  a little nice present in form of some interesting food. Isn't that
  nice?

## Modern UIs

By modern UIs, which I like, I mean the current state of app and web
design, where minimalism rules, and by old UIs, which I dislike, I
mean 90s utilitarian [WIMP] design. The best examples I can give of
them is [GNOME] and [Windows 95] respectively. In my opinion the
principles of modern UI design do a much better job in the following
aspects:

[WIMP]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)
[GNOME]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME
[Windows 95]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95

* Being eyecandy. In contrast to old UIs, where everything is composed
  of ugly static gray uniform blocks, modern UIs greatly emphasize
  looking epic. One of the ways this is being done is by using
  animations. To me personally, they make using the apps more smooth
  and comfortable and create an illusion of the app being something
  more than just a couple of pixel surfaces on your screen.
* Reduced complexity. In contrast to old UIs, where you can have as
  many features as possible, making your menus grow arbitrarily long,
  in modern UIs you have to think about making everything fit on the
  phone screen. As a result, the designs have to be pretty minimalist
  with features abstracted in logical ways. This makes the already
  simple apps even less complex and hides the complexity of complex
  ones in a clever way.
* User friendliness. The days of needing to read a manual to use
  software are long gone. Professional software still requires you to
  learn it, but it's at least not so bad. Making software accessible
  by being obvious is a great thing, and we shouldn't go back.
* Less clutter. Modern UIs put a much greater emphasis on whitespace
  while old UIs tried to make the interface as compact as possible. In
  my opinion, this is a great thing because it makes it much easier to
  visually scan the information and makes everything look even nicer.

## Modern music

First of all, let's get one thing out of the way: I don't think there
is such a thing as "bad music." Any music has an audience, and as long
as it satisfies someone, it's good. You may not personally like modern
music, but that doesn't make it bad. Yes, even if the music is getting
less complex, you can't call it "objectively bad" because it still
serves its purpose of being listened to.

Second, I think we truly live in a wonderful time in terms of music.
We still have all of the nice genres from the past but we also have
people making new stuff, including in those old genres. The new stuff
does a great favor to the music by exploring the boundaries of what's
possible to do with sounds. So in the end, I think if try hard enough
you'll be able to enjoy *some* modern music too. For example, I'm a
big jazz fan, but I also like dubstep.

## Star Wars prequels

It's widely known that the Star Wars prequels turned out to be not
what was expected from the franchise, but in my opinion, it's not
necessarily a bad thing. First, let's be honest, the quality of the
movies wasn't that bad. Yes, the Episode 1 was a kind of rough start,
but it gets much better in the end, and overall the quality of the
film isn't low. Relatively speaking, you can't call the trilogy "bad."
It surely isn't as classical as the original trilogy but still is
interesting to watch. Second, this trilogy has a very nice thing that
it shares with the original trilogy - originality. It introduced so
many different characters, places, and concepts, but it still felt
like a Star Wars movie series. The same can't be said about the
sequels though. They lack absolutely any originality and basically
copy the original trilogy in a quite shitty way. For this reason, I
can say that the prequels are not that bad, especially compared to the
sequels.
